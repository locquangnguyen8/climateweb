24309325	Rare, sporadic uterine leiomyomas arise in the setting of severe metabolic aberration due to a somatic fumarate hydratase mutation. Germline mutations account for the hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome, which predisposes for cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas and aggressive renal cell carcinomas. Altered fumarate hydratase leads to fumarate accumulation in affected cells with formation of S-(2-succino)-cysteine, which can be detected with the polyclonal antibody. High levels of these modified cysteine residues are found characteristically in fumarate hydratase-deficient cells but not in normal tissues or tumors unassociated with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome. We hypothesized that S-(2-succino)-cysteine-positive leiomyomas, indicating fumarate hydratase aberration, have morphologic features that differ from those without S-(2-succino)-cysteine positivity. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of uterine smooth-muscle tumors were prospectively analyzed for features suggesting hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome, such as prominent eosinophilic macronucleoli with perinucleolar halos, yielding nine cases. Germline genetic testing for fumarate hydratase mutations was performed in three cases. A detailed morphological analysis was undertaken, and S-(2-succino)-cysteine immunohistochemical analysis was performed with controls from a tissue microarray (leiomyomas (19), leiomyosarcomas (29), and endometrial stromal tumors (15)). Of the nine study cases, four had multiple uterine smooth muscle tumors. All cases had increased cellularity, staghorn vasculature, and fibrillary cytoplasm with pink globules. All cases had inclusion-like nucleoli with perinuclear halos (7 diffuse, 1 focal). All showed diffuse granular cytoplasmic labeling with the S-(2-succino)-cysteine antibody. Two of three tested patients had germline fumarate hydratase mutations. Only one leiomyoma from the tissue microarray controls was immunohistochemically positive, and it showed features similar to other immunohistochemically positive cases. Smooth-muscle tumors with fumarate hydratase aberration demonstrate morphological reproducibility across cases and S-(2-succino)-cysteine immuno-positivity. Although the features described are not specific for the germline fumarate hydratase mutation or the hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome, their presence should suggest fumarate hydratase aberration. Identifying these cases is an important step in the diagnostic workup of patients with possible hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma.
31883977	C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) is a transcription factor that is elevated in adipose tissue across many models of diabetes and metabolic stress. Although increased CHOP levels are associated with the terminal response to endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis, there is no evidence for CHOP mediated apoptosis in the adipose tissue during diabetes. CHOP protein levels increase in parallel with protein succination, a fumarate derived cysteine modification, in the adipocyte during metabolic stress. We investigated the factors contributing to sustained CHOP proteins levels in the adipocyte, with an emphasis on the regulation of CHOP protein turnover by metabolite-driven modification of Keap1 cysteines. CHOP protein stability was investigated in conditions of nutrient stress due to high glucose or elevated fumarate (fumarase knockdown model); where cysteine succination is specifically elevated. CHOP protein turnover is significantly reduced in models of elevated glucose and fumarate with a ~30% increase in CHOP stability (p > 0.01), in part due to decreased CHOP phosphorylation. Sustained CHOP levels occur in parallel with elevated heme-oxygenase-1, a production of increased Nrf2 transcriptional activity and Keap1 modification. While Keap1 is directly succinated in the presence of excess fumarate derived from genetic knockdown of fumarase (fumarate levels are elevated >20-fold), it is the oxidative modification of Keap1 that predominates in adipocytes matured in high glucose (fumarate increases 4-5 fold). Elevated fumarate indirectly regulates CHOP stability through the induction of oxidative stress. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reduces fumarate levels, protein succination and CHOP levels in adipocytes matured in high glucose. Elevated CHOP does not contribute elevated apoptosis in adipocytes, but plays a redox-dependent role in decreasing the adipocyte secretion of interleukin-13, an anti-inflammatory chemokine. NAC treatment restores adipocyte IL-13 secretion, confirming the redox-dependent regulation of a potent anti-inflammatory eotaxin. This study demonstrates that physiological increases in the metabolite fumarate during high glucose exposure contributes to the presence of oxidative stress and sustained CHOP levels in the adipocyte during diabetes. The results reveal a novel metabolic link between mitochondrial metabolic stress and reduced anti-inflammatory adipocyte signaling as a consequence of reduced CHOP protein turnover.
19236308	Human m-NAD(P)-ME [mitochondrial NAD(P)+-dependent ME (malic enzyme)] is a homotetramer, which is allosterically activated by the binding of fumarate. The fumarate-binding site is located at the dimer interface of the NAD(P)-ME. In the present study, we decipher the functional role of the residue Lys57, which resides at the fumarate-binding site and dimer interface, and thus may be involved in the allosteric regulation and subunit-subunit interaction of the enzyme. In the present study, Lys57 is replaced with alanine, cysteine, serine and arginine residues. Site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis strongly suggest that Lys57 is important for the fumarate-induced activation and quaternary structural organization of the enzyme. Lys57 mutant enzymes demonstrate a reduction of Km and an elevation of kcat following induction by fumarate binding, and also display a much higher maximal activation threshold than WT (wild-type), indicating that these Lys57 mutant enzymes have lower affinity for the effector fumarate. Furthermore, mutation of Lys57 in m-NAD(P)-ME causes the enzyme to become less active and lose co-operativity. It also increased K0.5,malate and decreased kcat values, indicating that the catalytic power of these mutant enzymes was significantly impaired following mutation of Lys57. Analytical ultracentrifugation analysis demonstrates that the K57A, K57S and K57C mutant enzymes dissociate predominantly into dimers, with some monomers present, whereas the K57R mutant forms a mixture of dimers and tetramers, with a small amount of the enzyme in monomeric form. The dimeric form of these Lys57 mutants, however, cannot be reconstituted into tetramers with the addition of fumarate. Modelling structures of the Lys57 mutant enzymes show that the hydrogen bond network in the dimer interface where Lys57 resides may be reduced compared with WT. Although the fumarate-induced activation effects are partially maintained in these Lys57 mutant enzymes, the mutant enzymes cannot be reconstituted into tetramers through fumarate binding and cannot recover their full enzymatic activity. In the present study, we demonstrate that the Lys57 residue plays dual functional roles in the structural integrity of the allosteric site and in the subunit-subunit interaction at the dimer interface of human m-NAD(P)-ME.
8417779	A simple system for aerobic assay of the quinol-fumarate reductase reaction catalyzed by purified soluble bovine heart succinate-ubiquinone reductase in the presence of NADH, NAD(P)H-quinone reductase (DT-diaphorase) and an appropriate quinone is described. The reaction is inhibited by carboxin, suggesting that the same quinone/quinol binding site is involved in electron transfer from succinate to ubiquinone and from ubiquinol to fumarate. The kinetic properties of the reaction in both directions and comparative affinities of the substrate binding sites of the enzyme to substrates (products) and competitive inhibitors are reported. Considerable difference in affinity of the substrates binding site to oxaloacetate was demonstrated when the enzyme was assayed in the direct and reverse directions. These results were taken to indicate that the oxidized dicarboxylate-free enzyme is an intermediate during the steady-state succinate-ubiquinone reductase reaction, whereas the reduced dicarboxylate-free enzyme is an intermediate of the steady-state ubiquinol-fumarate reductase reaction. No difference in the reactivity of the substrate-protected cysteine and arginine residues was found when the pseudo-first-order rate constants for N-ethylmaleimide and phenylglyoxal inhibition were determined for oxidized and quinol-reduced enzyme. Quinol-fumarate reductase activity was reconstituted from the soluble succinate dehydrogenase and low-molecular-mass ubiquinone reactivity conferring protein(s). No reduction of cytochrome b was observed in the presence of quinol generating system, whereas S-3 low temperature EPR-detectable iron-sulfur center was completely reduced by quinol under equilibrium (without fumarate) or steady-state (in the presence of fumarate). No significant reduction of ferredoxin type iron-sulfur centers was detected during the steady-state quinol-fumarate oxidoreductase reaction. The data obtained eliminate participation of cytochrome b in the quinol-fumarate reductase reaction and show that the rate limiting step of the overall reaction lies between iron-sulfur center S-3 and lower midpoint potential redox components of the enzyme.
26224635	"Various bacteria perform anaerobic degradation of small hydrocarbons as a source of energy and cellular carbon. To activate non-reactive hydrocarbons such as toluene, enzymes conjugate these molecules to fumarate in a radical-catalyzed, C-C bond-forming reaction. We have determined x-ray crystal structures of the glycyl radical enzyme that catalyzes the addition of toluene to fumarate, benzylsuccinate synthase (BSS), in two oligomeric states with fumarate alone or with both substrates. We find that fumarate is secured at the bottom of a long active site cavity with toluene bound directly above it. The two substrates adopt orientations that appear ideal for radical-mediated C-C bond formation; the methyl group of toluene is positioned between fumarate and a cysteine that forms a thiyl radical during catalysis, which is in turn adjacent to the glycine that serves as a radical storage residue. Toluene is held in place by fumarate on one face and tight packing by hydrophobic residues on the other face and sides. These hydrophobic residues appear to become ordered, thus encapsulating toluene, only in the presence of BSSβ, a small protein subunit that forms a tight complex with BSSα, the catalytic subunit. Enzymes related to BSS are able to metabolize a wide range of hydrocarbons through attachment to fumarate. Using our structures as a guide, we have constructed homology models of several of these ""X-succinate synthases"""" and determined conservation patterns that will be useful in understanding the basis for catalysis and specificity in this family of enzymes."""
28289076	Germ line mutations of the gene encoding the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH) cause a hereditary cancer syndrome known as hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC). HLRCC-associated tumors harbor biallelic FH inactivation that results in the accumulation of the TCA cycle metabolite fumarate. Although it is known that fumarate accumulation can alter cellular signaling, if and how fumarate confers a growth advantage remain unclear. Here we show that fumarate accumulation confers a chronic proliferative signal by disrupting cellular iron signaling. Specifically, fumarate covalently modifies cysteine residues on iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2), rendering it unable to repress ferritin mRNA translation. Simultaneously, fumarate increases ferritin gene transcription by activating the NRF2 (nuclear factor [erythroid-derived 2]-like 2) transcription factor. In turn, increased ferritin protein levels promote the expression of the promitotic transcription factor FOXM1 (Forkhead box protein M1). Consistently, clinical HLRCC tissues showed increased expression levels of both FOXM1 and its proliferation-associated target genes. This finding demonstrates how FH inactivation can endow cells with a growth advantage.
35216667	Fumarate is an oncometabolite. However, the mechanism underlying fumarate-exerted tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, utilizing human type2 papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC2) as a model, we show that fumarate accumulates in cells deficient in fumarate hydratase (FH) and inhibits PTEN to activate PI3K/AKT signaling. Mechanistically, fumarate directly reacts with PTEN at cysteine 211 (C211) to form S-(2-succino)-cysteine. Succinated C211 occludes tethering of PTEN with the cellular membrane, thereby diminishing its inhibitory effect on the PI3K/AKT pathway. Functionally, re-expressing wild-type FH or PTEN C211S phenocopies an AKT inhibitor in suppressing tumor growth and sensitizing PRCC2 to sunitinib. Analysis of clinical specimens indicates that PTEN C211 succination levels are positively correlated with AKT activation in PRCC2. Collectively, these findings elucidate a non-metabolic, oncogenic role of fumarate in PRCC2 via direct post-translational modification of PTEN and further reveal potential stratification strategies for patients with FH loss by combinatorial AKTi and sunitinib therapy.
24909641	Protein succination is a stable post-translational modification that occurs when fumarate reacts with cysteine residues to generate 2SC [S-(2-succino)cysteine]. We demonstrate that both α- and β-tubulin are increasingly modified by succination in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in the adipose tissue of db/db mice. Incubation of purified tubulin from porcine brain with fumarate (50 mM) or the pharmacological compound DMF (dimethylfumarate, 500 μM) inhibited polymerization up to 35% and 59% respectively. Using MS we identified Cys347α, Cys376α, Cys12β and Cys303β as sites of succination in porcine brain tubulin and the relative abundance of succination at these cysteine residues increased in association with fumarate concentration. The increase in succination after incubation with fumarate altered tubulin recognition by an anti-α-tubulin antibody. Succinated tubulin in adipocytes cultured in high glucose compared with normal glucose also had reduced reactivity with the anti-α-tubulin antibody; suggesting that succination may interfere with tubulin-protein interactions. DMF reacted rapidly with 11 of the 20 cysteine residues in the αβ-tubulin dimer, decreased the number of free thiols and inhibited the proliferation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. Our data suggest that inhibition of tubulin polymerization is an important undocumented mechanism of action of DMF. Taken together, our results demonstrate that succination is a novel post-translational modification of tubulin and suggest that extensive modification by fumarate, either physiologically or pharmacologically, may alter microtubule dynamics.
30633445	This work proposes a novel approach by which to consistently classify cysteine sites in proteins in terms of their reactivity toward dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and fumarate. Dimethyl fumarate-based drug products have been approved for use as oral treatments for psoriasis and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The adduction of DMF and its (re)active metabolites to certain cysteine residues in proteins is thought to underlie their effects. However, only a few receptors for these compounds have been discovered to date. Our approach takes advantage of the growing number of known DMF- and fumarate-sensitive proteins and sites to perform analyses by combining the concepts of network theory, for protein structure analyses, and machine-learning procedures. Wide-ranging and previously unforeseen variety is found in the analysis of the neighborhood composition (the first neighbors) of cysteine sites found in DMF- and fumarate-sensitive proteins. Furthermore, neighborhood composition has shown itself to be a network-type attribute that is endowed with remarkable predictive power when distinct classification algorithms are employed. In conclusion, when adopted in combination with other target identification/validation approaches, methods that are based on the analysis of cysteine site neighbors in proteins should provide useful information by which to decipher the mode of action of DMF-based drugs.
36936874	Mitochondrial stress increases the production of fumarate, an intermediate of the Krebs cycle. Fumarate non-enzymatically reacts with the thiol group of cysteine, leading to the production of S-(2-succinyl)cysteine. Here, we quantified the concentration of fumarate, the free form of S-(2-succinyl)cysteine, and advanced glycation end-products, including N -(carboxymethyl)lysine and N -(5-hydro-5-methyl-4-imidazolone-2-yl)-ornithine, in the serum of chronic kidney disease patients, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and an enzymatic assay. In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated the difference in metabolite concentration between healthy individuals (n=22) and kidney transplant patients (n=93). Additionally, we evaluated the metabolite concentration of end-stage renal disease patients (n=17) before and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after transplantation, in a longitudinal study. While the S-(2-succinyl)cysteine and AGEs levels were significantly increased in accordance with the rising chronic kidney disease severity, they were significantly decreased after transplantation. However, fumarate levels were only significantly different in end-stage renal disease patients. The S-(2-succinyl)cysteine levels correlated with the pre-existing kidney function marker. This study demonstrates that mitochondrial metabolic disorders contribute to impaired kidney function, and that measuring blood S-(2-succinyl)cysteine levels may be a minimally invasive way to evaluate the metabolic change in chronic kidney disease.
1856194	Menaquinol-fumarate oxidoreductase of Escherichia coli is a four-subunit membrane-bound complex that catalyzes the final step in anaerobic respiration when fumarate is the terminal electron acceptor. The enzyme is structurally and catalytically similar to succinate dehydrogenase (succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) from both procaryotes and eucaryotes. Both enzymes have been proposed to contain an essential cysteine residue at the active site based on studies with thiol-specific reagents. Chemical modification studies have also suggested roles for essential histidine and arginine residues in catalysis by succinate dehydrogenase. In the present study, a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification techniques have been used to investigate the role(s) of the conserved histidine 232, cysteine 247, and arginine 248 residues of the flavorprotein subunit (FrdA) in active site function. A role for His-232 and Arg-248 of FrdA is shown by loss of both fumarate reductase and succino-oxidase activities following site-directed substitution of these particular amino acids. Evidence is also presented that suggests a second arginine residue may form part of the active site. Potential catalytic and substrate-binding roles for arginine are discussed. The effects of removing histidine-232 of FrdA are consistent with its proposed role as a general acid-base catalyst. The fact that succinate oxidation but not fumarate reduction was completely lost, however, might suggest that alternate proton donors substitute for His-232. The data confirm that cysteine 247 of FrdA is responsible for the N-ethylmaleimide sensitivity shown by fumarate reductase but is not required for catalytic activity or the tight-binding of oxalacetate, as previously thought.
32820045	An important context in which metabolism influences tumorigenesis is the genetic cancer syndrome hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC), a disease in which mutation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH) causes hyperaccumulation of fumarate. This electrophilic oncometabolite can alter gene activity at the level of transcription, via reversible inhibition of epigenetic dioxygenases, as well as posttranslationally, via covalent modification of cysteine residues. To better understand the potential for metabolites to influence posttranslational modifications important to tumorigenesis and cancer cell growth, here we report a chemoproteomic analysis of a kidney-derived HLRCC cell line. Using a general reactivity probe, we generated a data set of proteomic cysteine residues sensitive to the reduction in fumarate levels caused by genetic reintroduction of active FH into HLRCC cell lines. This revealed a broad up-regulation of cysteine reactivity upon FH rescue, which evidence suggests is caused by an approximately equal proportion of transcriptional and posttranslational modification-mediated regulation. Gene ontology analysis highlighted several new targets and pathways potentially modulated by FH mutation. Comparison of the new data set with prior studies highlights considerable heterogeneity in the adaptive response of cysteine-containing proteins in different models of HLRCC. This is consistent with emerging studies indicating the existence of cell- and tissue-specific cysteine-omes, further emphasizing the need for characterization of diverse models. Our analysis provides a resource for understanding the proteomic adaptation to fumarate accumulation and a foundation for future efforts to exploit this knowledge for cancer therapy.
22524437	2SC [S-(2-succino)-cysteine] is a chemical modification formed by a Michael addition reaction of fumarate with cysteine residues in proteins. Formation of 2SC, termed 'succination' of proteins, increases in adipocytes grown in high-glucose medium and in adipose tissues of Type 2 diabetic mice. However, the metabolic mechanisms leading to increased fumarate and succination of protein in the adipocyte are unknown. Treatment of 3T3 cells with high glucose (30 mM compared with 5 mM) caused a significant increase in cellular ATP/ADP, NADH/NAD+ and Δψm (mitochondrial membrane potential). There was also a significant increase in the cellular fumarate concentration and succination of proteins, which may be attributed to the increase in NADH/NAD+ and subsequent inhibition of tricarboxylic acid cycle NAD+-dependent dehydrogenases. Chemical uncouplers, which dissipated Δψm and reduced the NADH/NAD+ ratio, also decreased the fumarate concentration and protein succination. High glucose plus metformin, an inhibitor of complex I in the electron transport chain, caused an increase in fumarate and succination of protein. Thus excess fuel supply (glucotoxicity) appears to create a pseudohypoxic environment (high NADH/NAD+ without hypoxia), which drives the increase in succination of protein. We propose that increased succination of proteins is an early marker of glucotoxicity and mitochondrial stress in adipose tissue in diabetes.
32820063	Activated macrophages undergo a metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis, accumulating Krebs' cycle intermediates that alter transcription of immune response genes. We extended these observations by defining fumarate as an inhibitor of pyroptotic cell death. We found that dimethyl fumarate (DMF) delivered to cells or endogenous fumarate reacts with gasdermin D (GSDMD) at critical cysteine residues to form S-(2-succinyl)-cysteine. GSDMD succination prevents its interaction with caspases, limiting its processing, oligomerization, and capacity to induce cell death. In mice, the administration of DMF protects against lipopolysaccharide shock and alleviates familial Mediterranean fever and experimental autoimmune encephalitis by targeting GSDMD. Collectively, these findings identify GSDMD as a target of fumarate and reveal a mechanism of action for fumarate-based therapeutics that include DMF, for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.
30718813	Hereditary cancer disorders often provide an important window into novel mechanisms supporting tumor growth. Understanding these mechanisms thus represents a vital goal. Toward this goal, here we report a chemoproteomic map of fumarate, a covalent oncometabolite whose accumulation marks the genetic cancer syndrome hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC). We applied a fumarate-competitive chemoproteomic probe in concert with LC-MS/MS to discover new cysteines sensitive to fumarate hydratase (FH) mutation in HLRCC cell models. Analysis of this dataset revealed an unexpected influence of local environment and pH on fumarate reactivity, and enabled the characterization of a novel FH-regulated cysteine residue that lies at a key protein-protein interface in the SWI-SNF tumor-suppressor complex. Our studies provide a powerful resource for understanding the covalent imprint of fumarate on the proteome and lay the foundation for future efforts to exploit this distinct aspect of oncometabolism for cancer diagnosis and therapy.
7739664	Complex II in adult mitochondria of the parasitic nematode, Ascaris suum, exhibits high fumarate reductase activity and plays a key role in the anaerobic electron-transport observed in these organelles. In the present study, cDNAs for the flavoprotein (Fp) subunits of complex II have been isolated, cloned and sequenced from both A. suum and the aerobic, free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. Additional sequence at the 3' end of the mRNAs was determined by the Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE). Nucleotide sequence analysis of the A. suum cDNAs revealed a 22-nucleotide trans-spliced leader sequence characteristic of many nematode mRNAs, an open reading frame of 1935 nucleotides and a 3' untranslated region of 616 nucleotides including a poly (A) tail from a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA). The open reading frame encoded a 645 amino acid sequence, including a 30 amino acid mitochondrial presequence. The amino acid sequences for the Fp subunits from both organisms were very similar, even though the ascarid enzyme functions physiologically as a fumarate reductase and the C. elegans enzyme a succinate dehydrogenase. The ascarid sequence was much less similar to the Escherichia coli fumarate reductase. The sensitivity of other Fp subunits to sulfhydryl reagents appears to reside in a cysteine immediately preceding a conserved arginine in the putative active site. In both nematode sequences, this cysteine is replaced by serine even though the succinate dehydrogenase activity of both enzymes is still sensitive to sulfhydryl inhibition. A cysteine six residues upstream of the serine may be involved in the sulfhydryl sensitivity of the nematode enzymes. Surprisingly, in contrast to succinate dehydrogenase activity, the fumarate reductase activity of the ascarid enzyme was not sensitive to sulfhydryl inhibition, suggesting that the mechanism of the two reactions involves separate catalytic processes.
16624247	S-(2-Succinyl)cysteine (2SC) has been identified as a chemical modification in plasma proteins, in the non-mercaptalbumin fraction of human plasma albumin, in human skin collagen, and in rat skeletal muscle proteins and urine. 2SC increases in human skin collagen with age and is increased in muscle protein of diabetic vs. control rats. The concentration of 2SC in skin collagen and muscle protein correlated strongly with that of the advanced glycation/lipoxidation end-product (AGE/ALE), N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML). 2SC is formed by a Michael addition reaction of cysteine sulfhydryl groups with fumarate at physiological pH. Fumarate, but not succinate, inactivates the sulfhydryl enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in vitro, in concert with formation of 2SC. 2SC is the first example of spontaneous chemical modification of protein by a metabolic intermediate in the Krebs cycle. These observations identify fumarate as an endogenous electrophile and suggest a role for fumarate in regulation of metabolism.
25793262	Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (also known as gastro-resistant dimethyl fumarate), an oral therapeutic containing dimethyl fumarate (DMF) as the active ingredient, is currently approved for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. DMF is also a component in a distinct mixture product with 3 different salts of monoethyl fumarate (MEF), which is marketed for the treatment of psoriasis. Previous studies have provided insight into the pharmacologic properties of DMF, including modulation of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), activation of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) pathway, and glutathione (GSH) modulation; however, those of MEF remain largely unexplored. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro effects of DMF and MEF on KEAP1 modification, activation of the NRF2 pathway, and GSH conjugation. Using mass spectrometry, DMF treatment resulted in a robust modification of specific cysteine residues on KEAP1. In comparison, the overall degree of KEAP1 modification following MEF treatment was significantly less or undetectable. Consistent with KEAP1 cysteine modification, DMF treatment resulted in nuclear translocation of NRF2 and a robust transcriptional response in treated cells, as did MEF; however, the responses to MEF were of a lower magnitude or distinct compared to DMF. DMF was also shown to produce an acute concentration-dependent depletion of GSH; however, GSH levels eventually recovered and rose above baseline by 24 hours. In contrast, MEF did not cause acute reductions in GSH, but did produce an increase by 24 hours. Overall, these studies demonstrate that DMF and MEF are both pharmacologically active, but have differing degrees of activity as well as unique actions. These differences would be expected to result in divergent effects on downstream biology.
35166937	Cysteine is non-enzymatically modified by fumarate, which is an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, leading to the formation of S-(2-succinyl)cysteine (2SC). Post-translational modification of physiological proteins by fumarate causes enzyme dysfunction. The aim of the study was to evaluate the changes in 2SC accumulation in physiological tissues associated with aging. Brain, liver, kidney, and serum samples were collected from 4-, 12-, and 96-week-old male C57BL/6J mice, and the level of 2SC was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) after pretreatment, including delipidation, protein precipitation, and hydrolysis using hydrochloric acid. The 2SC level in the brain was higher than that in other tissues, and its accumulation significantly increased with age. Similarly, N-(carboxymethyl)lysine levels, an advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) that accumulates in tissues in an age-dependent manner, was found to be increased in the brain and kidneys of elderly mice. Accumulation of N-(5-hydro-5-methyl-4-imidazolone-2-yl)-ornithine increased significantly with age, but only in the kidneys. The fumarate content in the brain was similar to that in the liver and kidney at 4 and 12weeks of age. Furthermore, fumarate contents increased in the liver and kidney at 96weeks of age, whereas its level did not change in the brain. Our results demonstrated that the changes in 2SC and AGEs levels in tissues reflected differing metabolism and enhanced oxidative stress in each organ; in particular, the metabolism in the brain and kidneys is highly affected by aging.
22134201	S-(2-succino)cysteine (2SC) is a chemical modification of proteins produced by reaction of fumarate with thiol groups in protein, a process known as succination. We propose to use the name S-(2-succino)cysteine (instead of S-(2-succinyl)cysteine) from this point on. This is to distinguish protein succination (in which fumarate forms a thioether linkage with cysteine residues) from succinylation (in which an ester, thioester or amide bond would be formed). Succination of proteins is increased in muscle of type 1 diabetic rats and in adipose tissue in type 2 diabetic mice. The increase in 2SC is a direct result of tissue accumulation of fumarate in response to nutrient excess and resultant mitochondrial stress in diabetes. In this study, we examine the breadth of succination of tissue proteins in the db/db type 2 model of diabetes. We also determined the extent of succination in epididymal adipocytes of type 1 (Akita, streptozotocin (STZ)) and type 2 (ob/ob, db/db) diabetic mice, in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, and in the adipose tissue of ground squirrels in various stages of hibernation. While succination was not increased in most tissues (brain, heart, kidney, liver, skeletal muscle) in the db/db model of diabetes, it was increased in all adipose beds of type 2 diabetic and DIO mice in comparison to their controls. Succination was not increased in adipocytes of type 1 diabetic mice. Adipose tissue from hibernating (HIB) 13-lined ground squirrels was also studied to determine if obesity in the absence of hyperglycemia affected succination of proteins. There were no differences in succination of proteins in brown or white adipose tissue over the torpor-arousal cycle. We conclude that 2SC is a biomarker of nutrient excess and mitochondrial stress in adipose tissue, increasing under the hyperglycemic and insulin resistant conditions associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity.
25105836	Inherited mutations in the Krebs cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH) predispose to hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC). Loss of FH activity in HLRCC tumours causes accumulation of the Krebs cycle intermediate fumarate to high levels, which may act as an oncometabolite through various, but not necessarily mutually exclusive, mechanisms. One such mechanism, succination, is an irreversible non-enzymatic modification of cysteine residues by fumarate, to form S-(2-succino)cysteine (2SC). Previous studies have demonstrated that succination of proteins including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) and mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2) can have profound effects on cellular metabolism. Furthermore, immunostaining for 2SC is a sensitive and specific biomarker for HLRCC tumours. Here, we performed a proteomic screen on an FH-mutant tumour and two HLRCC-derived cancer cell lines and identified 60 proteins where one or more cysteine residues were succinated; 10 of which were succinated at cysteine residues either predicted, or experimentally proven, to be functionally significant. Bioinformatic enrichment analyses identified most succinated targets to be involved in redox signaling. To our knowledge, this is the first proteomic-based succination screen performed in human tumours and cancer-derived cells and has identified novel 2SC targets that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of HLRCC.
32264016	We present a novel methodology to generate recodable surfaces using cysteine-rich domains (CRD) via a combination of photolithography and reversible covalently peptide-driven disulfide formation. Therefore, two 21mer CRD peptide derivatives were synthesized, one bearing an electron deficient fumarate group for immobilization via nitrile imine-ene mediated cycloaddition (NITEC) to a tetrazole-functional surface. Secondly, a bromine moiety is introduced to the CRD for analytic labelling purposes to detect surface encoding. The photolithography is conducted by selectively passivating the surface with a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-fumarate via NITEC using a photomask in a dotted pattern. Consecutively, the CRD-fumarate is immobilized via NITEC adjacent to the PEG-functional areas to the unaffected tetrazole covered surface layer. Subsequently, the CRD-bromide is covalently linked to the CRD-fumarate by forming disulfide bonds under mild reoxidative conditions in a buffer solution. The CRD-bromide is released from the surface upon reduction to recover the prior state of the surface without the bromine marker. The analysis of the CRD precursors is based on electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The surface analytics were carried out via time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), unambiguously verifying the successful immobilization as well as coding and decoding of the CRD-bromide on the surface based on dynamically reversible disulfide bond formation.
21630274	Germline mutations in the FH gene encoding the Krebs cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase predispose to hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) syndrome. FH-deficient cells and tissues accumulate high levels of fumarate, which may act as an oncometabolite and contribute to tumourigenesis. A recently proposed role for fumarate in the covalent modification of cysteine residues to S-(2-succinyl) cysteine (2SC) (termed protein succination) prompted us to assess 2SC levels in our existing models of HLRCC. Herein, using a previously characterized antibody against 2SC, we show that genetic ablation of FH causes high levels of protein succination. We next hypothesized that immunohistochemistry for 2SC would serve as a metabolic biomarker for the in situ detection of FH-deficient tissues. Robust detection of 2SC was observed in Fh1 (murine FH)-deficient renal cysts and in a retrospective series of HLRCC tumours (n = 16) with established FH mutations. Importantly, 2SC was undetectable in normal tissues (n = 200) and tumour types not associated with HLRCC (n = 1342). In a prospective evaluation of cases referred for genetic testing for HLRCC, the presence of 2SC-modified proteins (2SCP) correctly predicted genetic alterations in FH in every case. In two series of unselected type II papillary renal cancer (PRCC), prospectively analysed by 2SCP staining followed by genetic analysis, the biomarker accurately identified previously unsuspected FH mutations (2/33 and 1/36). The investigation of whether metabolites in other tumour types produce protein modification signature(s) that can be assayed using similar strategies will be of interest in future studies of cancer.
23499446	The gene encoding the Krebs cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH) is mutated in hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC). Loss of FH activity causes accumulation of intracellular fumarate, which can directly modify cysteine residues to form 2-succinocysteine through succination. We undertook a proteomic-based screen in cells and renal cysts from Fh1 (murine FH)-deficient mice and identified 94 protein succination targets. Notably, we identified the succination of three cysteine residues in mitochondrial Aconitase2 (ACO2) crucial for iron-sulfur cluster binding. We show that fumarate exerts a dose-dependent inhibition of ACO2 activity, which correlates with increased succination as determined by mass spectrometry, possibly by interfering with iron chelation. Importantly, we show that aconitase activity is impaired in FH-deficient cells. Our data provide evidence that succination, resulting from FH deficiency, targets and potentially alters the function of multiple proteins and may contribute to the dysregulated metabolism observed in HLRCC.
26450614	Elevated fumarate concentrations as a result of Krebs cycle inhibition lead to increases in protein succination, an irreversible post-translational modification that occurs when fumarate reacts with cysteine residues to generate S-(2-succino)cysteine (2SC). Metabolic events that reduce NADH re-oxidation can block Krebs cycle activity; therefore we hypothesized that oxidative phosphorylation deficiencies, such as those observed in some mitochondrial diseases, would also lead to increased protein succination. Using the Ndufs4 knockout (Ndufs4 KO) mouse, a model of Leigh syndrome, we demonstrate for the first time that protein succination is increased in the brainstem (BS), particularly in the vestibular nucleus. Importantly, the brainstem is the most affected region exhibiting neurodegeneration and astrocyte and microglial proliferation, and these mice typically die of respiratory failure attributed to vestibular nucleus pathology. In contrast, no increases in protein succination were observed in the skeletal muscle, corresponding with the lack of muscle pathology observed in this model. 2D SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting for succinated proteins and MS/MS analysis of BS proteins allowed us to identify the voltage-dependent anion channels 1 and 2 as specific targets of succination in the Ndufs4 knockout. Using targeted mass spectrometry, Cys(77) and Cys(48) were identified as endogenous sites of succination in voltage-dependent anion channels 2. Given the important role of voltage-dependent anion channels isoforms in the exchange of ADP/ATP between the cytosol and the mitochondria, and the already decreased capacity for ATP synthesis in the Ndufs4 KO mice, we propose that the increased protein succination observed in the BS of these animals would further decrease the already compromised mitochondrial function. These data suggest that fumarate is a novel biochemical link that may contribute to the progression of the neuropathology in this mitochondrial disease model.
35587148	Covalent inhibitors are viable therapeutics. However, off-target reactivity challenges the field. Chemists have attempted to solve this issue by varying the reactivity attributes of electrophilic warheads. Here, we report the development of an approach to increase the selectivity of covalent molecules that is independent of warhead reactivity features and can be used in concert with existing methods. Using the scaffold of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor Ibrutinib for our proof-of-concept, we reasoned that increasing the steric bulk of fumarate-based electrophiles on Ibrutinib should improve selectivity via the steric exclusion of off-targets but retain rates of cysteine reactivity comparable to that of an acrylamide. Using chemical proteomic techniques, we demonstrate that elaboration of the electrophile to a tert-butyl (t-Bu) fumarate ester decreases time-dependent off-target reactivity and abolishes time-independent off-target reactivity. While an alkyne-bearing probe analogue of Ibrutinib has 247 protein targets, our t-Bu fumarate probe analogue has only 7. Of these 7 targets, BTK is the only time-independent target. The t-Bu inhibitor itself is also more selective for BTK, reducing off-targets by 70%. We investigated the consequences of treatment with Ibrutinib and our t-Bu analogue and discovered that only 8 proteins are downregulated in response to treatment with the t-Bu analogue compared to 107 with Ibrutinib. Of these 8 proteins, 7 are also downregulated by Ibrutinib and a majority of these targets are associated with BTK biology. Taken together, these findings reveal an opportunity to increase cysteine-reactive covalent inhibitor selectivity through electrophilic structure optimization.
36309089	Succination is the spontaneous reaction between the respiratory intermediate fumarate and cellular thiols that forms stable S-(2-succino)-adducts such as S-(2-succino)cysteine (2SC). 2SC is a biomarker for conditions associated with elevated fumarate levels, including diabetes, obesity, and certain cancers, and succination likely contributes to disease progression. Bacillus subtilis has a yxe operon-encoded breakdown pathway for 2SC that involves three distinct enzymatic conversions. The first step is N-acetylation of 2SC by YxeL to form N-acetyl-2SC (2SNAC). YxeK catalyzes the oxygenation of 2SNAC, resulting in its breakdown to oxaloacetate and N-acetylcysteine, which is deacetylated by YxeP to give cysteine. The monooxygenase YxeK is key to the pathway but is rare, with close homologs occurring infrequently in prokaryote and fungal genomes. The existence of additional 2SC breakdown pathways was not known prior to this study. Here, we used comparative genomics to identify a S-(2-succino) lyase (2SL) that replaces yxeK in some yxe gene clusters. 2SL genes from Enterococcus italicus and Dickeya dadantii complement B. subtilis yxeK mutants. We also determined that recombinant 2SL enzymes efficiently break down 2SNAC into fumarate and N-acetylcysteine, can perform the reverse reaction, and have minor activity against 2SC and other small molecule thiols. The strong preferences both YxeK and 2SL enzymes have for 2SNAC indicate that 2SC acetylation is a conserved breakdown step. The identification of a second naturally occurring 2SC breakdown pathway underscores the importance of 2SC catabolism and defines a general strategy for 2SC breakdown involving acetylation, breakdown, and deacetylation.
20688139	Tributyl phosphate (TBP) is a toxic organophosphorous compound widely used in many industrial applications, including significant usage in nuclear processing. The industrial application of this chemical is responsible for occupational exposure and environmental pollution. In this study, (1)H NMR-based metabonomics has been applied to investigate the metabolic response to TBP exposure. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given a TBP-dose of 15 mg/kg body weight, followed by 24h urine collection, as was previously demonstrated for finding most of the intermediates of TBP. High-resolution (1)H NMR spectroscopy of urine samples in conjunction with statistical pattern recognition and compound identification allowed for the metabolic changes associated with TBP treatment to be identified. Discerning NMR spectral regions corresponding to three TBP metabolites, dibutyl phosphate (DBP), N-acetyl-(S-3-hydroxybutyl)-L-cysteine and N-acetyl-(S-3-oxobutyl)-L-cysteine, were identified in TBP-treated rats. In addition, the (1)H NMR spectra revealed TBP-induced variations of endogenous urinary metabolites including benzoate, urea, and trigonelline along with metabolites involved in the Krebs cycle including citrate, cis-aconitate, trans-aconitate, 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, and fumarate. These findings indicate that TBP induces a disturbance to the Krebs cycle energy metabolism and provides a biomarker signature of TBP exposure. We show that three metabolites of TBP, dibutylphosphate, N-acetyl-(S-3-hydroxybutyl)-L-cysteine and N-acetyl-(S-3-oxobutyl)-L-cysteine, which are not present in the control groups, are the most important factors in separating the TBP and control groups (p<0.0023), while the endogenous compounds 2-oxoglutarate, benzoate, fumarate, trigonelline, and cis-aconetate were also important (p<0.01).
20964553	Cysteine is arguably the most reactive amino acid in protein. A wide range of cysteine derivatives is formed in vivo, resulting from oxidation, nitrosation, alkylation and acylation reactions. This review describes succination of proteins, an irreversible chemical modification of cysteine by the Krebs cycle intermediate, fumarate, yielding S-(2-succinyl)cysteine (2SC). Intracellular fumarate concentration and succination of proteins are increased by hyperpolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane and develop in concert with mitochondrial and oxidative stress in diabetes. Increased succination of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase explains the loss in specific activity of this enzyme in muscle of streptozotocin-diabetic rats and increased succination of adiponectin may explain the decreased secretion of adiponectin from adipose tissue in type 2 diabetes. In addition to GAPDH and adiponectin, other succinated proteins identified in adipocytes include cytoskeletal proteins (tubulin, actin) and chaperone proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Succination of adipocyte protein in vitro is inhibited by uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and by inhibitors of ER stress. 2SC serves as a biomarker of mitochondrial stress and recent studies suggest that succination is the mechanistic link between mitochondrial and ER stress in diabetes.
24115015	The post-translational modifications (PTMs) of cysteine residues include oxidation, S-glutathionylation, S-nitrosylation, and succination, all of which modify protein function or turnover in response to a changing intracellular redox environment. Succination is a chemical modification of cysteine in proteins by the Krebs cycle intermediate, fumarate, yielding S-(2-succino)cysteine (2SC). Intracellular fumarate concentration and succination of proteins are increased by hyperpolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane, in concert with mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress in 3T3 adipocytes grown in high glucose medium and in adipose tissue in obesity and diabetes in mice. Increased succination of proteins is also detected in the kidney of a fumarase deficient conditional knock-out mouse which develops renal cysts. A wide range of proteins are subject to succination, including enzymes, adipokines, cytoskeletal proteins, and ER chaperones with functional cysteine residues. There is also some overlap between succinated and glutathionylated proteins, suggesting that the same low pKa thiols are targeted by both. Succination of adipocyte proteins in diabetes increases as a result of nutrient excess derived mitochondrial stress and this is inhibited by uncouplers, which discharge the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and relieve the electron transport chain. 2SC therefore serves as a biomarker of mitochondrial stress or dysfunction in chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and cancer, and recent studies suggest that succination is a mechanistic link between mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative and ER stress, and cellular progression toward apoptosis. In this article, we review the history of the succinated proteome and the challenges associated with measuring this non-enzymatic PTM of proteins by proteomics approaches.
29626092	Cellular thiols such as cysteine spontaneously and readily react with the respiratory intermediate fumarate, resulting in the formation of stable S-(2-succino)-adducts. Fumarate-mediated succination of thiols increases in certain tumors and in response to glucotoxicity associated with diabetes. Therefore, S-(2-succino)-adducts such as S-(2-succino)cysteine (2SC) are considered oncometabolites and biomarkers for human disease. No disposal routes for S-(2-succino)-compounds have been reported prior to this study. Here, we show that Bacillus subtilis metabolizes 2SC to cysteine using a pathway encoded by the yxe operon. The first step is N-acetylation of 2SC followed by an oxygenation that we propose results in the release of oxaloacetate and N-acetylcysteine, which is deacetylated to give cysteine. Knockouts of the genes predicted to mediate each step in the pathway lose the ability to grow on 2SC as the sulfur source and accumulate the expected upstream metabolite(s). We further show that N-acetylation of 2SC relieves toxicity. This is the first demonstration of a metabolic disposal route for any S-(2-succino)-compound, paving the way toward the identification of corresponding pathways in other species.
2504145	Mammalian and Escherichia coli succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and E. coli fumarate reductase apparently contain an essential cysteine residue at the active site, as shown by substrate-protectable inactivation with thiol-specific reagents. Bacillus subtilis SDH was found to be resistant to this type of reagent and contains an alanine residue at the amino acid position equivalent to the only invariant cysteine in the flavoprotein subunit of E. coli succinate oxidoreductases. Substitution of this alanine, at position 252 in the flavoprotein subunit of B. subtilis SDH, by cysteine resulted in an enzyme sensitive to thiol-specific reagents and protectable by substrate. Other biochemical properties of the redesigned SDH were similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. It is concluded that the invariant cysteine in the flavoprotein of E. coli succinate oxidoreductases corresponds to the active site thiol. However, this cysteine is most likely not essential for succinate oxidation and seemingly lacks an assignable specific function. An invariant arginine in juxtaposition to Ala-252 in the flavoprotein of B. subtilis SDH, and to the invariant cysteine in the E. coli homologous enzymes, is probably essential for substrate binding.
2844784	The subunit location of the [2Fe-2S], [3Fe-4S], and [4Fe-4S] clusters in Escherichia coli fumarate reductase has been investigated by EPR studies of whole cells or whole cells extracts of a fumarate reductase deletion mutant with plasmid amplified expression of discrete fumarate reductase subunits or groups of subunits. The results indicate that both the [2Fe-2S] and [3Fe-4S] clusters are located entirely in the iron-sulfur protein subunit. Information concerning the specific cysteine residues that ligate these clusters has been obtained by investigating the EPR characteristics of cells of the deletion mutant amplified with a plasmid coding for the flavoprotein subunit and a truncated iron-sulfur protein subunit. While the results are not definitive with respect to the location of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, they are most readily interpreted in terms of this cluster being entirely in the flavoprotein subunit or bridging between the two catalytic domain subunits. These new results are discussed in light of the amino acid sequences of the two subunits and the sequences of structurally well characterized iron-sulfur proteins containing [2Fe-2S], [3Fe-4S], and [4Fe-4S] centers.
6751504	Fumarate reductase, purified from the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli, has been cross-linked with the bifunctional reagent dimethylsuberimidate and shown to exist as an alpha beta dimer of polypeptides of molecular weights 69,000 and 25,000 in a 1:1 molar ratio. The protein has an s20,w of 7.67S and a D20,w of 6.5 X 10(-7) cm2/s. The purified enzyme contained 4-5 mol of nonheme iron and 4-5 mol of acid labile sulfur while the visible absorption spectrum showed a broad peak between 400 and 470 nm owing to the presence of an Fe-S centre and 8 alpha[N-3]histidyl FAD. Fumarate reductase activity was readily inhibited by the sulfhydryl reagents 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), p-chloromercuribenzoate, and iodoacetamide. Using 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) sulfhydryl group modification was followed as a function of enzyme activity. A single cysteine residue was shown to be required for activity and this essential sulfhydryl group was located in the 69,000 dalton subunit. The amino acid composition of E. coli fumarate reductase was similar to the succinate dehydrogenases from beef heart mitochondrion and Rhodospirillum rubrum.
17726021	Although obesity is a risk factor for development of type 2 diabetes and chemical modification of proteins by advanced glycoxidation and lipoxidation end products is implicated in the development of diabetic complications, little is known about the chemical modification of proteins in adipocytes or adipose tissue. In this study we show that S-(2-succinyl)cysteine (2SC), the product of chemical modification of proteins by the Krebs cycle intermediate, fumarate, is significantly increased during maturation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to adipocytes. Fumarate concentration increased > or =5-fold during adipogenesis in medium containing 30 mm glucose, producing a > or =10-fold increase in 2SC-proteins in adipocytes compared with undifferentiated fibroblasts grown in the same high glucose medium. The elevated glucose concentration in the medium during adipocyte maturation correlated with the increase in 2SC, whereas the concentration of the advanced glycoxidation and lipoxidation end products, N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine and N(epsilon)-(carboxyethyl)lysine, was unchanged under these conditions. Adipocyte proteins were separated by one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis and approximately 60 2SC-proteins were detected using an anti-2SC polyclonal antibody. Several of the prominent and well resolved proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. These include cytoskeletal proteins, enzymes, heat shock and chaperone proteins, regulatory proteins, and a fatty acid-binding protein. We propose that the increase in fumarate and 2SC is the result of mitochondrial stress in the adipocyte during adipogenesis and that 2SC may be a useful biomarker of mitochondrial stress in obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes.
22014577	The Krebs cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH) is a human tumor suppressor whose inactivation is associated with the development of leiomyomata, renal cysts, and tumors. It has been proposed that activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) by fumarate-mediated inhibition of HIF prolyl hydroxylases drives oncogenesis. Using a mouse model, we provide genetic evidence that Fh1-associated cyst formation is Hif independent, as is striking upregulation of antioxidant signaling pathways revealed by gene expression profiling. Mechanistic analysis revealed that fumarate modifies cysteine residues within the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), abrogating its ability to repress the Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant response pathway, suggesting a role for Nrf2 dysregulation in FH-associated cysts and tumors.
22866264	The drive to understand how altered cellular metabolism and cancer are linked has caused a paradigm shift in the focus of cancer research. The discovery of a mutated metabolic enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, that leads to accumulation of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, provided significant direct evidence that dysfunctional metabolism plays an important role in oncogenesis. Striking parallels exist with the Krebs cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH), a tumor suppressor, whose mutation is associated with the development of leiomyomata, renal cysts, and tumors. Loss of FH enzymatic activity results in accumulation of intracellular fumarate which has been proposed to act as a competitive inhibitor of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases including the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) hydroxylases, thus activating oncogenic HIF pathways. Interestingly, our studies have questioned the role of HIF and have highlighted other candidate mechanisms, in particular the non-enzymatic modification of cysteine residues (succination) that could lead to disruption or loss of protein functions, dysfunctional cell metabolism and cell signaling. Here, we discuss the evidence for proposing fumarate as an onco-metabolite.
29263788	Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an electrophilic compound previously called BG-12 and marketed under the name Tecfidera . It was approved in 2013 by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. One mechanism of action of DMF is stimulation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) transcriptional pathway that induces anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory phase II enzymes to prevent chronic neurodegeneration. However, electrophiles such as DMF also produce severe systemic side effects, in part due to non-specific S-alkylation of cysteine thiols and resulting depletion of glutathione. This mini-review presents the present status and future strategy for NRF2 activators designed to avoid these side effects. Two modes of chemical reaction leading to NRF2 activation are considered here. The first mode is S-alkylation (covalent reaction) of thiols in Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), which interacts with NRF2. The second mechanism involves non-covalent pharmacological inhibition of protein-protein interactions, in particular domain-specific interaction between NRF2 and KEAP1 or other repressor proteins involved in this transcriptional pathway. There have been significant advances in drug development using both of these mechanisms that can potentially avoid the systemic side effects of electrophilic compounds. In the first case concerning covalent reaction with KEAP1, monomethyl fumarate and monoethyl fumarate appear to represent safer derivatives of DMF. In a second approach, pro-electrophilic drugs, such as carnosic acid from the herb Rosmarinus officinalis, can be used as a safe pro-drug of an electrophilic compound. Concerning non-covalent activation of NRF2, drugs are being developed that interfere with the direct interaction of KEAP1-NRF2 or inhibit BTB domain and CNC homolog 1 (BACH1), which is a transcriptional repressor of the promoter where NRF2 binds.
29508062	Fumarate adduction to cysteines has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several disorders. Its role, however, still remains elusive, and the need of predictive methods has not yet been met. The reactivity of cysteines found in fumarate-sensitive proteins was predicted when the collected data for eight network-type features were analyzed using classification models. Therefore, methods for evaluating the likelihood of a cysteine site to be modified by fumarate could be developed by combining concepts of network theory and machine learning.
32803208	Cadmium (Cd) adversely affects human health by entering the food chain via anthropogenic activity. In order to mitigate risk, a better understanding of the biogeochemical mechanisms limiting Cd mobility in the environment is needed. While Cd is not redox-active, Cd speciation varies (i.e., aqueous, complexed, adsorbed), and influences mobility. Here, the cycling of Cd in relation to initial speciation during the growth of Geobacter sulfurreducens was studied. Either fumarate or ferrihydrite (Fh) was provided as an electron acceptor and Cd was present as: (1) an aqueous cation, (2) an aqueous complex with cysteine, which is often present in metal stressed soil environments, or (3) adsorbed to Fh. During microbial Fe(iii) reduction, the removal of Cd was substantial (∼80% removal), despite extensive Fe(ii) production (ratio Fe(ii)total : Fetotal = 0.8). When fumarate was the electron acceptor, there was higher removal from solution when Cd was complexed with cysteine (97-100% removal) compared to aqueous Cd (34-50%) removal. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) demonstrated the formation of exopolymeric substances (EPS) in all conditions and that Cd was correlated with EPS in the absence of Fe minerals (r = 0.51-0.56). Most notable is that aqueous Cd was more strongly correlated with Geobacter cells (r = 0.72) compared to Cd-cysteine complexes (r = 0.51). This work demonstrates that Cd interactions with cell surfaces and EPS, and Cd solubility during metabolic activity are dependent upon initial speciation. These processes may be especially important in soil environments where sulfur is limited and Fe and organic carbon are abundant.
2244791	The genes of the fumarate reductase of Wolinella succinogenes are organized in an operon. The three structural genes in the order frdC, frdA, frdB, are preceded by a common promoter (Körtner et al. 1990) and followed by a terminator of transcription. The proteins encoded by the genes are identical with the subunits present in the isolated enzyme. FrdA and FrdB are hydrophilic proteins consisting of 656 and 238 amino acids, respectively. The 12 cysteine residues present in FrdB form 3 ferredoxin-like clusters, whereas the 12 cysteines of FrdA are not clustered. Expression of FrdA and FrdB in Escherichia coli from a plasmid containing a DNA fragment with both genes in full length, gave rise to the EPR signals of the bi- and trinuclear iron-sulfur centers of the enzyme. Only the binuclear center was seen on the expression of FrdB together with a C-terminal fragment of FrdA (130 amino acid residues). Neither of the two centers was detected on the expression of FrdA together with a N-terminal fragment of FrdB including cysteine cluster I. Sequence comparison of FrdA and FrdB with the corresponding subunits of the fumarate reductases of E. coli or Proteus vulgaris or to those of the succinate dehydrogenases of E. coli or Bacillus subtilis revealed strong homologies (28-36% identical amino acid residues). Part of the homologous peptide stretches could be assigned to domains that are involved in the binding of the substrate of the FAD prosthetic group of the enzyme.
7548762	Conjugation reactions of glutathione (GSH) and related thiols with diethyl maleate (DEM) and other alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds have been investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The products from the reaction with DEM and diethyl fumarate (DEF) are shown to be the diastereomers of S-(alpha,beta-diethoxycarbonylethyl)glutathione. During the course of the reaction, DEM isomerized to DEF, and the rate of isomerization was dependent upon whether the solvent was 1H2O or 2H2O. The observed rate data exhibit apparent second order kinetic behavior. The reaction of maleate with GSH was considerably slower, and solvent-dependent isomerization was observed, while little reaction of fumarate with GSH was observed at pH 6.5. Reaction of DEM with N-acetyl-L-cysteine followed a similar course to that of GSH, and although L-cysteine reacted rapidly with DEM, it did not promote the isomerization of DEM. Reactions involving penicillamine and N-acetylpenicillamine were considerably slower. Conjugation reactions catalyzed by commercial GSH transferases and selected rat and human purified isoenzymes were also investigated. Of those isoenzymes studied, rat GSH transferase 4-4 was found to exert the greatest degree of stereo control in conjugation reactions with DEF.
10216159	The succinate dehydrogenase complex of the thermoacidophilic archaeon Acidianus ambivalens was investigated kinetically and by EPR spectroscopy in its most intact form, i.e., membrane bound. Here it is shown that this respiratory complex has an unusual iron-sulfur cluster composition in respect to that of the canonical succinate dehydrogenases known. The spectroscopic studies show that center S3, the succinate responsive [3Fe-4S]1+/0 cluster of succinate dehydrogenases, is not present in membranes prepared from aerobically grown A. ambivalens, nor in partially purified complex fractions. On the other hand, EPR features associated to the remaining centers, clusters S1 ([2Fe-2S]1+/2+) and S2 ([4Fe-4S]2+/1+), could be observed. Similar findings were made in other archaea, namely Acidianus infernus and Sulfolobus solfataricus. Kinetic investigations showed that the A. ambivalens enzyme is reversible, capable of operating as a fumarate reductase - a required activity if this obligate autotroph performs CO2 fixation via a reductive citric acid cycle. Sequencing of the sdh operon confirmed the spectroscopic data. Center S3 ([3Fe-4S]) is indeed replaced by a second [4Fe-4S] center, by incorporation of an additional cysteine, at the cysteine cluster binding motif (CxxYxxCxxxC-->CxxCxxCxxxC). Genomic analysis shows that genes encoding for succinate dehydrogenases similar to the ones here outlined are also present in bacteria, which may indicate a novel family of succinate/fumarate oxidoreductases, spread among the Archaea and Bacteria domains.
14666145	The aim of the experiment was to determine the effect of potential antioxidants (adenosine, L-cysteine hydrochloride, ascorbic acid, magnesium fumarate and prolactin) supplementing the Biosolwens extender on semen survival time and sperm chromatin structure. The semen motility was examined every day and the susceptibility of sperm chromatin to denaturation was evaluated on collection day and day 15 of storage. The addition of magnesium fumarate to Biosolwens extender increased sperm survival but resulted in the highest increment in the proportion of sperm with damaged chromatin. Biosolwens supplemented with 200 mg of L-cysteine hydrochloride brought the best results. It is possible that lower concentrations of this component would act in a more protective manner. The examination of the chromatin structure appears to be an useful tool for investigation of semen preservation.
17934141	(2-succinyl)cysteine (2SC) is formed by a Michael addition reaction of the Krebs cycle intermediate, fumarate, with cysteine residues in protein. We investigated the role of fumarate in chemical modification and inhibition of the sulfhydryl enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), in vitro and in tissues of diabetic rats.
19592500	S-(2-Succinyl)cysteine (2SC) is formed by reaction of the Krebs cycle intermediate fumarate with cysteine residues in protein, a process termed succination of protein. Both fumarate and succination of proteins are increased in adipocytes cultured in high glucose medium (Nagai, R., Brock, J. W., Blatnik, M., Baatz, J. E., Bethard, J., Walla, M. D., Thorpe, S. R., Baynes, J. W., and Frizzell, N. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 34219-34228). We show here that succination of protein is also increased in epididymal, mesenteric, and subcutaneous adipose tissue of diabetic (db/db) mice and that adiponectin is a major target for succination in both adipocytes and adipose tissue. Cys-39, which is involved in cross-linking of adiponectin monomers to form trimers, was identified as a key site of succination of adiponectin in adipocytes. 2SC was detected on two of seven monomeric forms of adiponectin immunoprecipitated from adipocytes and epididymal adipose tissue. Based on densitometry, 2SC-adiponectin accounted for approximately 7 and 8% of total intracellular adiponectin in cells and tissue, respectively. 2SC was found only in the intracellular, monomeric forms of adiponectin and was not detectable in polymeric forms of adiponectin in cell culture medium or plasma. We conclude that succination of adiponectin blocks its incorporation into trimeric and higher molecular weight, secreted forms of adiponectin. We propose that succination of proteins is a biomarker of mitochondrial stress and accumulation of Krebs cycle intermediates in adipose tissue in diabetes and that succination of adiponectin may contribute to the decrease in plasma adiponectin in diabetes.
26683377	In breast tumors, activation of the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) pathway promotes survival, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, stem cell-like properties, and resistance to therapy--all phenotypes of aggressive disease where therapy options remain limited. Adding an anti-inflammatory/anti-NFκB agent to breast cancer treatment would be beneficial, but no such drug is approved as either a monotherapy or adjuvant therapy. To address this need, we examined whether dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an anti-inflammatory drug already in clinical use for multiple sclerosis, can inhibit the NFκB pathway. We found that DMF effectively blocks NFκB activity in multiple breast cancer cell lines and abrogates NFκB-dependent mammosphere formation, indicating that DMF has anti-cancer stem cell properties. In addition, DMF inhibits cell proliferation and significantly impairs xenograft tumor growth. Mechanistically, DMF prevents p65 nuclear translocation and attenuates its DNA binding activity but has no effect on upstream proteins in the NFκB pathway. Dimethyl succinate, the inactive analog of DMF that lacks the electrophilic double bond of fumarate, is unable to inhibit NFκB activity. Also, the cell-permeable thiol N-acetyl l-cysteine, reverses DMF inhibition of the NFκB pathway, supporting the notion that the electrophile, DMF, acts via covalent modification. To determine whether DMF interacts directly with p65, we synthesized and used a novel chemical probe of DMF by incorporating an alkyne functionality and found that DMF covalently modifies p65, with cysteine 38 being essential for the activity of DMF. These results establish DMF as an NFκB inhibitor with anti-tumor activity that may add therapeutic value in the treatment of aggressive breast cancers.
29599194	Activated immune cells undergo a metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis akin to the Warburg effect, thereby presenting a potential therapeutic target in autoimmune disease. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a derivative of the Krebs cycle intermediate fumarate, is an immunomodulatory drug used to treat multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. Although its therapeutic mechanism remains uncertain, DMF covalently modifies cysteine residues in a process termed succination. We found that DMF succinates and inactivates the catalytic cysteine of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in mice and humans, both in vitro and in vivo. It thereby down-regulates aerobic glycolysis in activated myeloid and lymphoid cells, which mediates its anti-inflammatory effects. Our results provide mechanistic insight into immune modulation by DMF and represent a proof of concept that aerobic glycolysis is a therapeutic target in autoimmunity.
34607241	A metabolomics study was conducted to investigate the molecular bases of oocyte over-ripening in common carp, Cyprinus carpio from a metabolic point of view. The ovulation was induced in fish brooders by intramuscular injection of pituitary extract and oocytes were collected four times post-ovulation with 30 min intervals. A set of 32 metabolites were identified on the NMR spectra of the oocytes, which mainly included energy-linked metabolites, amino acids, methylated metabolites and citric acid cycle (TCA) intermediates. PCA and PLS-DA models clearly separated the post ovulations times, indicating the effects of post-ovulation time on oocyte metabolome content. Based on the loading plot outputs, 15 metabolites including tryptophan, cysteine, AMP, tyrosine, valine, creatine phosphate (PCr), ATP, leucine, inosine, malate, acetate, TMAO, glucose, fumarate and lysine had more effects on the separation of post ovulation times. According to the results of metabolite profiling, the concentrations of glutamine, alanine, tryptophan, lysine and cysteine mostly significantly (P < 0.01) increased at 90 and 120 min post-ovulation. The concentrations of PCr, ATP, inosine and guanosine were relatively stable until 60 min post-ovulation, while significantly (P < 0.01) decreased at 90 and 120 min post ovulation. The TCA metabolites succinate, malate and fumarate significantly (P < 0.01) elevated at 90 and 120 min post-ovulation. AMP concentrations remained relatively unchanged until 30 min and then progressively decreased with time post ovulation (P < 0.01). The concentrations of lactate showed significant elevations at 90 and 120 min post ovulation (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the energetic potentials of the oocytes reduced with time post ovulation. There were apparent elevations in the concentrations of free amino acids, which may be associated with the onset of proteolytic activities in the post ovulatory oocytes. In addition, we found some changes in the apoptotic-related metabolites, which may support the results of previous studies regarding the oxidative stress and following apoptosis in post ovulatory oocytes of fish.
2668693	FNR, the transcriptional regulator of gene expression of anaerobic respiration in Escherichia coli, contains a cluster of cysteine residues at the amino terminus which resembles the metal-binding domains of metal-binding proteins. It is possible, therefore, (i) that FNR binds metals with the cysteines as ligands and (ii) that this property is related to the regulatory function of FNR. These questions were investigated, with the following results. Approximately 2.4 of the 4 cysteine residues of FNR can be alkylated with iodoacetate in permeabilized aerobic or anaerobic bacteria without the addition of reducing agents. The time required for half-maximal labelling of the cysteines was 50 min in anaerobic bacteria and 6 min in aerobic bacteria. The difference in the reactivity was specific for the cysteines of FNR. These cysteine residues were also highly reactive in anaerobically grown bacteria, when the growth medium contained chelating agents such as 1,10-phenanthroline (15 microM). The effect of the chelating agents was reversed by an excess of divalent metal ions such as Fe(II) or Cu(II) in the medium. The presence of 1,10-phenanthroline (10 microM) also inhibits the expression of fumarate reductase, an FNR-dependent enzyme. These results suggest that FNR exists in two different forms which differ in terms of the reactivity of their cysteine residues to iodoacetate. The interconversion of both forms appears to be regulated by the availability of O2 and by the binding of metal ions. The two forms of FNR may be involved in the regulation of O2-dependent gene expression.
7748886	Succinate:quinone reductases (SQRs) and quinol:fumarate reductases (QFRs) each contain a bi-, a tri- and a tetra-nuclear iron-sulfur cluster. The C-terminal half of the iron-sulfur protein subunit of these enzymes shows two fully conserved motifs of cysteine residues, stereotypical for ligands of [3Fe-4S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters. To analyze the functional role of the trinuclear cluster S3 in Bacillus subtilis SQR, a fourth cysteine residue was introduced into the putative ligation motif to that cluster. A corresponding mutation in Escherichia coli QFR results in a tri- to tetranuclear conversion (Manodori et al. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 2703-2731). We have found that presence of the extra cysteine in B. subtilis SQR does not result in cluster conversion. It does, however, affect the EPR properties of the cluster S3, whereas those of the other two clusters remain normal. The results strongly support the view that residues in the most C-terminal cysteine motif in the iron-sulfur protein subunit of SQRs and QFRs ligate the trinuclear cluster. Compared to wild-type SQR, S3 in the B. subtilis mutant enzyme is not sensitive to methanol and the midpoint redox potential is close to normal. The quinone reductase activity of the mutant enzyme is only 35% of normal. Thus, the architecture around cluster S3 plays a role in electron transfer to quinone or in the binding of quinone to the enzyme.
15135079	The oxygen sensor fumarate nitrate reductase regulator (FNR) of Escherichia coli contains in the active (anaerobic) state a [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster which is lost after exposure to O(2). In aerobically prepared apoFNR, or in FNR obtained by treatment of [4Fe-4S] . FNR with O(2) in vitro, intramolecular cysteine disulfides are found, including the cysteine residues which serve as ligands for the Fe-S cluster. It is shown here that the reconstitution of [4Fe-4S] . FNR from this form of aerobic apoFNR was preceded by a long lag phase when glutathione was used as the reducing agent. Addition of E. coli glutaredoxins (Grx) 1, 2 or 3 decreased the lag phase greatly and stimulated the reconstitution rate slightly (about twofold). Reconstitution of anaerobically prepared apoFNR, which has a lower cysteine disulfide content, showed only a short lag phase, which further decreased in the presence of Grx. It is concluded that in the lag phase the cysteine disulfides of apoFNR become reduced for the incorporation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster and that this reaction is stimulated by Grx. Thioredoxin (Trx) 1 showed no stimulation of FNR reconstitution in vitro. It is suggested that the function of Grx might be of significance for the insertion of FeS cluster in proteins containing disulfides.
30581146	Ferroptosis is a regulated necrosis process driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Although ferroptosis and cellular metabolism interplay with one another, whether mitochondria are involved in ferroptosis is under debate. Here, we demonstrate that mitochondria play a crucial role in cysteine-deprivation-induced ferroptosis but not in that induced by inhibiting glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4), the most downstream component of the ferroptosis pathway. Mechanistically, cysteine deprivation leads to mitochondrial membrane potential hyperpolarization and lipid peroxide accumulation. Inhibition of mitochondrial TCA cycle or electron transfer chain (ETC) mitigated mitochondrial membrane potential hyperpolarization, lipid peroxide accumulation, and ferroptosis. Blockage of glutaminolysis had the same inhibitory effect, which was counteracted by supplying downstream TCA cycle intermediates. Importantly, loss of function of fumarate hydratase, a tumor suppressor and TCA cycle component, confers resistance to cysteine-deprivation-induced ferroptosis. Collectively, this work demonstrates the crucial role of mitochondria in cysteine-deprivation-induced ferroptosis and implicates ferroptosis in tumor suppression.
34510734	Thiol-containing nucleophiles such as cysteine react spontaneously with the citric acid cycle intermediate fumarate to form S-(2-succino)-adducts. In Bacillus subtilis, a salvaging pathway encoded by the yxe operon has recently been identified for the detoxification and exploitation of these compounds as sulfur sources. This route involves acetylation of S-(2-succino)cysteine to N-acetyl-2-succinocysteine, which is presumably converted to oxaloacetate and N-acetylcysteine, before a final deacetylation step affords cysteine. The critical oxidative cleavage of the C-S bond of N-acetyl-S-(2-succino)cysteine was proposed to depend on the predicted flavoprotein monooxygenase YxeK. Here, we characterize YxeK and verify its role in S-(2-succino)-adduct detoxification and sulfur metabolism. Detailed biochemical and mechanistic investigation of YxeK including 18 O-isotope-labeling experiments, homology modeling, substrate specificity tests, site-directed mutagenesis, and (pre-)steady-state kinetics provides insight into the enzyme's mechanism of action, which may involve a noncanonical flavin-N5-peroxide species for C-S bond oxygenolysis.
2174169	Site-directed mutants of Escherichia coli fumarate reductase in which each of the four N-terminal cysteine residues in the FrdB subunit, residues 57, 62, 65, and 77, was mutated individually to serine have been constructed, overexpressed, and investigated in terms of enzymatic activity as well as the EPR and redox properties of the iron-sulfur centers. In each case, the mutant contains a functional fumarate reductase in which all three of the constituent iron-sulfur clusters (i.e., center 1, [2Fe-2S]; center 2, [4Fe-4S]; center 3, [3Fe-4S]) have been assembled. The mutations affect the properties of center 1 only and demonstrate that the anomalously high redox potential of this [2Fe-2S] center is essential for optimal enzymatic activity. The results are consistent with cysteines 57, 62, 65, and 77 providing the ligands to center 1 but leave open the possibility of noncysteinyl coordination for the localized valence Fe(III) site of the reduced cluster. The implications of the results for the role of center 1 in the electron-transfer pathway and the valence localization of reduced center 1 are discussed.
3027051	The nucleotide sequence of a 2.7-kilobase segment of DNA containing the sdhA and sdhB genes encoding the flavoprotein (Fp, sdhA) and iron-sulfur protein (Ip, sdhB) subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase of Bacillus subtilis was determined. This sequence extends the previously reported sequence encoding the cytochrome b558 subunit (sdhC) and completes the sequence of the sdh operon, sdhCAB. The predicted molecular weights for the Fp and Ip subunits, 65,186 (585 amino acids) and 28,285 (252 amino acids), agreed with the values determined independently for the labeled Fp and Ip antigens, although it appeared that the B. subtilis Fp was not functional after expression of the sdhA gene in Escherichia coli. Both subunits closely resembled the corresponding Fp and Ip subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and fumarate reductase of E. coli in size, composition, and amino acid sequence. The sequence homologies further indicated that the B. subtilis SDH subunits are equally related to the SDH and fumarate reductase subunits of E. coli but are less closely related than are the corresponding pairs of E. coli subunits. The regions of highest sequence conservation were identifiable as the catalytically significant flavin adenine dinucleotide-binding sites and cysteine clusters of the iron-sulfur centers.
4455192	1. Washed suspensions of two Achromobacter species (G2 and 2L), capable of growth upon 2- and 3-hydroxypyridine respectively as sources of C and N, rapidly oxidized their growth substrate pyridine-2,5-diol (2,5-dihydroxypyridine) and the putative ring-cleavage product maleamate without a lag. Suspensions derived from fumarate plus (NH(4))(2)SO(4) cultures were unable to do so. 2. Extracts of both bacteria oxidized pyridine-2,5-diol with the stoicheiometry of an oxygenase forming 1mol of NH(3)/mol of substrate. 3. Heat-treated extracts, however, formed maleamate and formate with little free NH(3). 4. The conversion of maleamate into maleate plus NH(3) by extracts of strain 2L, fractionated with (NH(4))(2)SO(4), and the metabolism of maleamate and maleate to fumarate by extracts of both strains demonstrated the existence of the enzymes catalysing each reaction of the maleamate pathway in these bacteria. 5. The pyridine-2,5-diol dioxygenase (mol.wt. approx. 340000) in extracts of these Achromobacter species required Fe(2+) (1.7mum) to restore full activity after dialysis or treatment with chelating agents; the enzyme from strain 2L also had a specific requirement for l-cysteine (6.7mm), which could not be replaced by GSH or dithiothreitol. 6. The oxygenase was strongly inhibited in a competitive manner by the isomeric pyridine-2,3- and -3,4-diols.
6383359	The nucleotide sequence of a 3614 base-pair segment of DNA containing the sdhA gene, encoding the flavoprotein subunit of succinate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli, and two genes sdhC and sdhD, encoding small hydrophobic subunits, has been determined. Together with the iron-sulphur protein gene (sdhB) these genes form an operon (sdhCDAB) situated between the citrate synthase gene (gltA) and the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex genes (sucAB): gltA-sdhCDAB-sucAB. Transcription of the gltA and sdhCDAB gene appears to diverge from a single intergenic region that contains two pairs of potential promoter sequences and two putative CRP (cyclic AMP receptor protein)-binding sites. The sdhA structural gene comprises 1761 base-pairs (587 codons, excluding the initiation codon, AUG) and it encodes a polypeptide of Mr 64268 that is strikingly homologous with the flavoprotein subunit of fumarate reductase (frdA gene product). The FAD-binding region, including the histidine residue at the FAD-attachment site, has been identified by its homology with other flavoproteins and with the flavopeptide of the bovine heart mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase. Potential active-site cysteine and histidine residues have also been indicated by the comparisons. The sdhC (384 base-pairs) and sdhD (342 base-pairs) structural genes encode two strongly hydrophobic proteins of Mr 14167 and 12792 respectively. These proteins resemble in size and composition, but not sequence, the membrane anchor proteins of fumarate reductase (the frdC and frdD gene products).
8846791	Bacillus subtilis is able to grow anaerobically using alternative electron acceptors, including nitrate or fumarate. We characterized an operon encoding the dissimilatory nitrate reductase subunits homologous to the Escherichia coli narGHJI operon and the narK gene encoding a protein with nitrite extrusion activity. Downstream from narK and co-transcribed with it a gene (fnr) encoding a protein homologous to E.coli FNR was found. Disruption of fnr abolished both nitrate and fumarate utilization as electron acceptors and anaerobic induction of narK. Four putative FNR binding sites were found in B.subtilis sequences. The consensus sequence, centred at position -41.5, is identical to the consensus for the DNA site for E.coli CAP. Bs-FNR contained a four cysteine residue cluster at its C-terminal end. This is in contrast to Ec-FNR, where a similar cluster is present at the N-terminal end. It is possible that oxygen modulates the activity of both activators by a similar mechanism involving iron. Unlike in E.coli, where fnr expression is weakly repressed by anaerobiosis, fnr gene expression in B.subtilis is strongly activated by anaerobiosis. We have identified in the narK-fnr intergenic region a promotor activated by anaerobiosis independently of FNR. Thus induction of genes involved in anaerobic respiration requires in B.subtilis at least two levels of regulation: activation of fnr transcription and activation of FNR to induce transcription of FNR-dependent promoters.
11816975	The transcription factor Fnr (fumarate nitrate reductase regulator) globally regulates gene expression in response to oxygen deprivation in Escherichia coli. We report here the cloning and sequencing of the fnr gene from the facultative anaerobic bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae M5al, another member of the enteric bacteria. The deduced amino acid sequence of K. pneumoniae fnr showed very high similarity (98% amino acid identity) to the Fnr protein from E. coli and contained the four essential cysteine residues which are presumed to build the oxygen-sensing [4Fe4S]+2 center. Transfer of the K. pneumoniae gene to a fnr mutant of E. coli complemented the mutation and permitted synthesis of nitrate reductase and fumarate reductase during anaerobic growth. A gene fusion between K. pneumoniae fnr and glutathione S-transferase was constructed and expressed in E. coli under anaerobic conditions in order to make the protein available in preparative amounts. The overproduced protein was purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography in the absence of oxygen, and biochemically characterized.
17165757	Benzylsuccinate synthase catalyzes the first step in the anaerobic metabolism of toluene through an unusual reaction in which toluene is added to fumarate to produce (R)-benzylsuccinate. We have exploited the broad substrate range of the enzyme to demonstrate that the enzyme can catalyze the exchange of p-cresol with the benzyl portion of benzylsuccinate to form (4-hydroxybenzyl)-succinate, indicating that the reverse reaction (disproportionation of benzylsuccinate to toluene and fumarate) must have occurred. Even though the equilibrium constant for the reverse reaction is extremely unfavorable, Keq approximately 8 x 10-11 M at 4 degrees C, the enzyme catalyzes the reverse reaction at a rate only 250-fold slower than the forward reaction. Furthermore, using deuterium-labeled benzylsuccinate we observe partial exchange of deuterium with the solvent. This provides the first direct evidence that the migrating hydrogen is transferred to a labile site on the protein during catalysis, which is consistent with the participation of the proposed active-site cysteine residue in the mechanism of BSS.
17609386	A fundamental challenge in the redox biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is to understand the mechanisms involved in sensing redox signals such as oxygen (O2), nitric oxide (NO), and nutrient depletion, which are thought to play a crucial role in persistence. Here we show that Mtb WhiB3 responds to the dormancy signals NO and O2 through its iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster. To functionally assemble the WhiB3 Fe-S cluster, we identified and characterized the Mtb cysteine desulfurase (IscS; Rv3025c) and developed a native enzymatic reconstitution system for assembling Fe-S clusters in Mtb. EPR and UV-visible spectroscopy analysis of reduced WhiB3 is consistent with a one-electron reduction of EPR silent [4Fe-4S]2+ to EPR visible [4Fe-4S]+. Atmospheric O2 gradually degrades the WhiB3 [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster to generate a [3Fe-4S]+ intermediate. Furthermore, EPR analysis demonstrates that NO forms a protein-bound dinitrosyl-iron-dithiol complex with the Fe-S cluster, indicating that NO specifically targets the WhiB3 Fe-S cluster. Our data suggest that the mechanism of WhiB3 4Fe-4S cluster degradation is similar to that of fumarate nitrate regulator. Importantly, Mtb DeltawhiB3 shows enhanced growth on acetate medium, but a growth defect on media containing glucose, pyruvate, succinate, or fumarate as the sole carbon source. Our results implicate WhiB3 in metabolic switching and in sensing the physiologically relevant host signaling molecules NO and O2 through its [4Fe-4S] cluster. Taken together, our results suggest that WhiB3 is an intracellular redox sensor that integrates environmental redox signals with core intermediary metabolism.
22764116	Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) plays a major role in initiating the cascade of osteogenesis. However, high doses of exogenous BMP2 coupled with diffusion away from the intended site cause adverse side-effects. An alternative is to use biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) grafted with peptides of the active domains of BMP2. NPs present a multivalent form of the peptide for stronger interaction with cell surface receptors, leading to a stronger activation of osteogenic signalling pathways. The objective of this work was to compare osteogenic activity of the BMP2 peptide (BMP2Pe), corresponding to residues 73-92 of BMP2 protein (BMP2Pr), grafted to biodegradable NPs with that of BMP2 protein (BMP2Pr). BMP2Pe was functionalized with a cysteine residue and grafted to poly(lactide fumarate) and poly(lactide-co-ethylene oxide fumarate) (PLAF/PLEOF) NPs via a thioether link. The calcium content of bone marrow stromal (BMS) cells cultured in osteogenic medium supplemented with BMP2 peptide/protein-grafted NPs (BMP2Pe-gNP and BMP2Pr-gNP) was slightly higher than other BMP2-treated groups, but all osteogenic groups showed similar levels of mineralization after 21 days. The expression pattern of master transcription factors Dlx5 and Runx2 indicated that BMP2 protein induced faster osteogenic signalling than the BMP peptide. The expression level of Osteopontin (OP), Osteocalcin (OC) and PECAM-1 in the NP-grafted BMP2 groups was significantly higher than those of ungrafted BMP2Pr and BMP2Pe groups, which may be due to a more effective presentation of the peptide/protein to cell surface receptors, thus leading to a stronger interaction of the peptide/protein with clustered cell surface receptors.
23812428	Cancer-associated mutations have been identified in the metabolic genes succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), fumarate hydratase (FH) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), advancing and challenging our understanding of cellular function and disease mechanisms and providing direct links between dysregulated metabolism and cancer. Some striking parallels exist in the cellular consequences of the genetic mutations within this triad of cancer syndromes, including accumulation of oncometabolites and competitive inhibition of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, particularly, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylases, JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases (part of the JMJD family) and the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of 5methyl cytosine (5mC) DNA hydroxylases. These lead to activation of HIF-dependent oncogenic pathways and inhibition of histone and DNA demethylation. Mutations in FH, resulting in loss of enzyme activity, predispose affected individuals to a rare cancer, hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC), characterised by benign smooth muscle cutaneous and uterine tumours (leiomyomata) and an aggressive form of collecting duct and type 2 papillary renal cancer. Interestingly, loss of FH activity results in the accumulation of high levels of fumarate that can lead to the non-enzymatic modification of cysteine residues in multiple proteins (succination) and in some cases to their disrupted function. Here we consider that the study of rare diseases such as HLRCC, combining analyses of human tumours and cell lines with in vitro and in vivo murine models has provided novel insights into cancer biology associated with dysregulated metabolism and represents a useful paradigm for cancer research.
23892396	Protein succination, the non-enzymatic modification of cysteine residues by fumarate, is distinguishable from succinylation, an enzymatic reaction forming an amide bond between lysine residues and succinyl-CoA. Treatment of adipocytes with 30 mM glucose significantly increases protein succination with only a small change in succinylation. Protein succination may be significantly increased intracellularly after treatment with fumaric acid esters, however, the ester must be removed by saponification to permit 2SC-antibody detection of the fumarate adduct.
24334767	Malignant pheochromocytoma (PCC) and paraganglioma (PGL) are mostly caused by germline mutations of SDHB, encoding a subunit of succinate dehydrogenase. Using whole-exome sequencing, we recently identified a mutation in the FH gene encoding fumarate hydratase, in a PCC with an 'SDH-like' molecular phenotype. Here, we investigated the role of FH in PCC/PGL predisposition, by screening for germline FH mutations in a large international cohort of patients. We screened 598 patients with PCC/PGL without mutations in known PCC/PGL susceptibility genes. We searched for FH germline mutations and large deletions, by direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification methods. Global alterations in DNA methylation and protein succination were assessed by immunohistochemical staining for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) and S-(2-succinyl) cysteine (2SC), respectively. We identified five pathogenic germline FH mutations (four missense and one splice mutation) in five patients. Somatic inactivation of the second allele, resulting in a loss of fumarate hydratase activity, was demonstrated in tumors with FH mutations. Low tumor levels of 5-hmC, resembling those in SDHB-deficient tumors, and positive 2SC staining were detected in tumors with FH mutations. Clinically, metastatic phenotype (P = 0.007) and multiple tumors (P = 0.02) were significantly more frequent in patients with FH mutations than those without such mutations. This study reveals a new role for FH in susceptibility to malignant and/or multiple PCC/PGL. Remarkably, FH-deficient PCC/PGLs display the same pattern of epigenetic deregulation as SDHB-mutated malignant PCC/PGL. Therefore, we propose that mutation screening for FH should be included in PCC/PGL genetic testing, at least for tumors with malignant behavior.
24441663	"Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder in which germline mutations of fumarate hydratase (FH) gene confer an increased risk of cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas and renal cancer. HLRCC-associated renal cancer is highly aggressive and frequently presents as a solitary mass. We reviewed the clinicopathologic features of 9 patients with renal tumors presenting as sporadic cases but who were later proven to have FH germline mutations. Histologically, all tumors showed mixed architectural patterns, with papillary as the dominant pattern in only 3 cases. Besides papillary, tubular, tubulopapillary, solid, and cystic elements, 6 of 9 tumors contained collecting duct carcinoma-like areas with infiltrating tubules, nests, or individual cells surrounded by desmoplastic stroma. Prominent tubulocystic carcinoma-like component and sarcomatoid differentiation were identified. Although all tumors exhibited the proposed hallmark of HLRCC (large eosinophilic nucleolus surrounded by a clear halo), this feature was often not uniformly present throughout the tumor. Prior studies have shown that a high level of fumarate accumulated in HLRCC tumor cells causes aberrant succination of cellular proteins by forming a stable chemical modification, S-(2-succino)-cysteine (2SC), which can be detected by immunohistochemistry. We thus explored the utility of detecting 2SC by immunohistochemistry in the differential diagnosis of HLRCC tumors and other high-grade renal tumors and investigated the correlation between 2SC staining and FH molecular alterations. All confirmed HLRCC tumors demonstrated diffuse and strong nuclear and cytoplasmic 2SC staining, whereas all clear cell (184/184, 100%), most high-grade unclassified (93/97, 96%), and the large majority of ""type 2"""" papillary (35/45"
27625306	Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an electrophilic drug that is used to treat autoimmune conditions, including multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. The mechanism of action of DMF is unclear but may involve the covalent modification of proteins or DMF serving as a prodrug that is converted to monomethyl fumarate (MMF). We found that DMF, but not MMF, blocked the activation of primary human and mouse T cells. Using a quantitative, site-specific chemical proteomic platform, we determined the DMF sensitivity of >2400 cysteine residues in human T cells. Cysteines sensitive to DMF, but not MMF, were identified in several proteins with established biochemical or genetic links to T cell function, including protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ). DMF blocked the association of PKCθ with the costimulatory receptor CD28 by perturbing a CXXC motif in the C2 domain of this kinase. Mutation of these DMF-sensitive cysteines also impaired PKCθ-CD28 interactions and T cell activation, designating the C2 domain of PKCθ as a key functional, electrophile-sensing module important for T cell biology.
28300276	We addressed uncertainties regarding hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) by exploring all French cases, representing the largest series to date. Fumarate hydratase (FH) germline testing was performed with Sanger sequencing and qPCR/MLPA. Enzyme activity was measured when necessary. We carried out whenever possible a pathology review of RCC and S-(2-succino)-cysteine (2SC)/fumarate hydratase immunohistochemistry. We estimated survival using non-parametric Kaplan-Meier. There were 182 cases from 114 families. Thirty-seven RCC were diagnosed in 34 carriers (19%) at a median age of 40. Among the 23 RCC with pathology review, 13 were papillary type 2. There were 4 papillary RCC of unspecified type, 3 unclassified, 2 tubulocystic, and 1 collecting duct (CD) RCC, all 2SC+ and most (8/10) FH-. Of the remaining 14, papillary type 2, papillary unspecified, CD, and clear cell histologies were reported. The vast majority of RCC (82%) were metastatic at diagnosis or rapidly became metastatic. Median survival for metastatic disease was 18 months (95%CI: 11-29). 133 cases (73%) had a history of cutaneous leiomyomas, 3 developed skin leiomyosarcoma. Uterine leiomyomas were frequent in women (77%), but no sarcomas were observed. Only 2 cases had pheochromocytomas/paraganglioma.
28863073	Leiomyoma with bizarre nuclei (LM-BN), is a variant of uterine smooth muscle tumor with atypical histologic features. Although some LM-BN share several significant genetic alterations with leiomyosarcoma, including p16 and p53, the underlying tumorigenesis of LM-BN remains largely unknown. As we previously reported, LM-BN can be divided into 2 subtypes, type I and type II, based on different nuclear features. Type I LM-BN have similar histologic features as uterine smooth muscle tumors with fumarate hydratase (FH) alterations. In this study, we examined FH expression and FH mutations in 77 LM-BN (40 type I cases and 37 type II cases). FH expression was examined by immunohistochemistry using S-(2-succino)-cysteine antibodies (2SC, a protein modification associated with FH inactivation and subsequent fumarate accumulation) and FH antibodies (FH gene products). Seventy-two LM-BN tumors underwent Sanger sequencing to detect FH mutations. We found that 51% (39/77) of LM-BN showed FH alterations detected by immunohistochemistry with both 2SC and FH. Mutational analysis showed that 21% (15/72) of LM-BN harbored FH gene mutations. Further analysis revealed that 85% (34/40) of those with FH alterations were type I LM-BN while 19% (7/37) were type II LM-BN. Our findings suggest that over half of histologically diagnosed LM-BN may be related to FH alterations or FH mutations and the majority of these have the characteristic histologic features of type I LM-BN.
31299266	Mutations of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDHX) enzyme subunits commonly lead to a loss of function of the holoenzyme complex, and germline SDHX mutations lead to a genetic predisposition to SDH-deficient neoplasms, including renal cell carcinomas (RCC). Similarly, loss-of-function alterations of fumarate hydratase (FH) leads to a genetic predisposition to hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC)-associated RCC. Loss of FH leads to an accumulation of fumarate and aberrantly high levels of S-(2-succino)-cysteine (2SC). Subtype-specific consecutively diagnosed renal cell neoplasms were selected for the study and cases were not otherwise selected based on clinicopathologic features. Tissue microarrays were constructed from 1009 renal cell neoplasms (papillary: 400, clear cell: 203, chromophobe: 87, oncocytomas [original diagnosis]: 273, unclassified: 46) and these cases were immunostained for SDHA/SDHB to screen for SDH loss. A smaller subset (n = 730; oncocytomas, papillary and unclassified RCCs) were screened for FH-deficiency using immunohistochemistry for FH/2SC. Loss of SDHA/SDHB was seen in three of 273 tumors originally diagnosed as oncocytomas (1.1%). Diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic 2SC staining, with retained FH expression was seen in one case (suggestive of dysfunctional FH protein), while absent FH was seen in 3 cases (2/400 papillary RCCs, 0.5% and 2/46 unclassified RCCs, 4.35%). No aberrant FH/2SC expression was noted in 273 cases originally diagnosed as oncocytomas. SDH-deficient RCCs were identified only in the cases originally diagnosed as oncocytomas (1.1%), while FH-deficient RCCs were identified in the papillary (0.5%) and unclassified RCC cohorts (4.35%). These results can help guide immunohistochemistry-based screening strategies for these tumors.
32210786	Human brain evolution toward complexity has been achieved with increasing energy supply as the main adaptation in brain metabolism. Energy metabolism, like other biochemical reactions in aerobic cells, is under enzymatic control and strictly regulated. Nevertheless, physiologically uncontrolled and deleterious reactions take place. It has been proposed that these reactions constitute the basic molecular mechanisms that underlie the maintenance or loss-of-function of neurons and, by extension, cerebral functions during brain aging. In this review article, we focus attention on the role of the nonenzymatic and irreversible adduction of fumarate to the protein thiols, which leads to the formation of S-(2-succino)cysteine (2SC; protein succination) in the human brain. In particular, we first offer a brief approach to the succination reaction, features related to the specificity of protein succination, methods for their detection and quantification, the bases for considering 2SC as a biomarker of mitochondrial stress, the succinated proteome, the cross-regional differences in 2SC content, and changes during brain aging, as well as the potential regulatory significance of fumarate and 2SC. We propose that 2SC defines cross-regional differences of metabolic mitochondrial stress in the human brain and that mitochondrial stress is sustained throughout the healthy adult lifespan in order to preserve neuronal function and survival.
33588983	A novel mesophilic sulfate-reducing bacterium, strain HN2T, was isolated from groundwater sampled from the subsurface siliceous mudstone of the Wakkanai Formation located in Horonobe, Hokkaido, Japan. The bacterium was Gram-negative and vibrio-shaped, and its motility was conferred by a single polar flagellum. Cells had desulfoviridin. Catalase and oxidase activities were not detected. It grew in the temperature range of 25-40C (optimum, 35C) and pH range of 6.3-8.1 (optimum, pH 7.2-7.6). It used sulfate, thiosulfate, dimethyl sulfoxide, anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate, Fe3+, and manganese oxide, but not elemental sulfur, nitrite, nitrate, or fumarate as electron acceptors. The strain showed weak growth with sulfite as the electron acceptor. Fermentative growth with pyruvate, lactate and cysteine was observed in the absence of sulfate, but not with malate or fumarate. NaCl was not required, but the strain tolerated up to 40g l-1. Strain HN2T did not require vitamins. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C15:0 (23.8%), C18:1 9t (18.4%), C18:0 (15.0%), C16:0 (14.5%), and anteiso-C17:0 (10.1%). The major respiratory quinone was menaquinone MK-6(H2). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 56.7mol%. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the closest phylogenetic relative of strain HN2T is Desulfovibrio psychrotolerans JS1T (97.0%). Digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) and average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of the strains HN2T and D. psychrotolerans JS1T were 22.2 and 79.8%, respectively. Based on the phenotypic and molecular genetic evidence, we propose a novel species, D. subterraneus sp. nov. with the type strain HN2T (=DSM 101010T=NBRC 112213T).
35306364	Fumarates (fumaric acid esters), primarily dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and monoethyl fumarate (MEF) and its salts, are orally administered systemic agents used for the treatment of psoriasis and multiple sclerosis. It is widely believed that the pharmaceutical activities of fumarates are exerted through the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. Although it has been revealed that DMF and MEF differentially modify specific Keap1 cysteine residues and result in the differential activation of Nrf2, how the modification of DMF and MEF impacts the biochemical properties of Keap1 has not been well characterized. Here, we found that both DMF and MEF can only modify the BTB domain of Keap1 and that only C151 is accessible for covalent binding in vitro. Dynamic fluorescence scanning (DSF) assays showed that the modification of DMF to Keap1 BTB increased its thermal stability, while the modification of MEF dramatically decreased its thermal stability. Further crystal structures revealed no significant conformational variation between the DMF-modified and MEF-modified BTBs. Overall, our biochemical and structural study provides a better understanding of the covalent modification of fumarates to Keap1 and may suggest fundamentally different mechanisms adopted by fumarates in regulating the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway.
36190452	Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is a cancer predisposition syndrome driven by mutation of the tumor suppressor fumarate hydratase (FH). Inactivation of FH causes accumulation of the electrophilic oncometabolite fumarate. In the absence of methods for reactivation, tumor suppressors can be targeted via identification of synthetic lethal interactions using genetic screens. Inspired by recent advances in chemoproteomic target identification, here, we test the hypothesis that the electrophilicity of the HLRCC metabolome may produce unique susceptibilities to covalent small molecules, a phenomenon we term conditional covalent lethality. Screening a panel of chemically diverse electrophiles, we identified a covalent ligand, MP-1, that exhibits FH-dependent cytotoxicity. Synthesis and structure-activity profiling identified key molecular determinants underlying the molecule's effects. Chemoproteomic profiling of cysteine reactivity together with clickable probes validated the ability of MP-1 to engage an array of functional cysteines, including one lying in the Zn-finger domain of the tRNA methyltransferase enzyme TRMT1. TRMT1 overexpression rescues tRNA methylation from inhibition by MP-1 and partially attenuates the covalent ligand's cytotoxicity. Our studies highlight the potential for covalent metabolites and small molecules to synergistically produce novel synthetic lethal interactions and raise the possibility of applying phenotypic screening with chemoproteomic target identification to identify new functional oncometabolite targets.
37050851	Fumarate hydratase deficient renal cell carcinoma (FHRCC) can exhibit a heterogenous immunoprofile. In the present case, a solitary 10.5 cm mixed cystic and solid left kidney tumor showed various growth patterns, involving renal sinus adipose tissue and the renal pelvis. Tumor cells showed prominent nucleoli and perinucleolar halos. Aberrant diffuse (>90%), strong, and membranous carbonic anhydrase 9 and variable GATA3 expression were present. Diagnostic loss of fumarate hydratase expression and 2-succinyl cysteine overexpression (cytoplasmic and nuclear) were identified. Carbonic anhydrase 9 and GATA3 expression in FHRCC is rarely reported in the literature, and may cause misdiagnosis of clear cell RCC and/or urothelial carcinoma.
37259915	Fumarate hydratase-deficient (FH-deficient) renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents a particularly aggressive form of kidney cancer. FH-deficient RCC arises in the setting of germline, or solely somatic, mutations in the FH gene, a two-hit tumor suppressor gene. Early detection can be curative, but there are no biomarkers, and in the sporadic setting, establishing a diagnosis of FH-deficient RCC is challenging. In this issue of the JCI, Zheng, Zhu, and co-authors report untargeted plasma metabolomic analyses to identify putative biomarkers. They discovered two plasma metabolites directly linked to fumarate overproduction by tumor cells, succinyl-adenosine and succinic-cysteine, which correlate with tumor burden. The identification of circulating biomarkers of FH-deficient RCC may aid in the diagnosis of FH-deficient RCC and provide a means for longitudinal follow-up.
1375942	The cDNA sequence of the flavoprotein subunit of bovine heart succinate dehydrogenase is reported. This is the first complete eukaryotic sequence of the flavoprotein subunit to be characterized, and it encodes a 665-amino acid protein that consists of a presequence and a 621-residue mature protein. The deduced bovine sequence shows homology to the corresponding peptides of prokaryotic succinate dehydrogenase and the related fumarate reductases; in particular, there is good overall homology (48%) to the flavoprotein subunit of Escherichia coli succinate dehydrogenase. The conserved sequences comprising the active site and those involved in FAD binding are also found in the bovine protein. The active site of the bovine polypeptide contains a cysteine that confers sensitivity of the enzyme to sulfhydryl reagents; this cysteine is only present in some sequences and thus provides a discriminatory biochemical marker. A putative flavoprotein subunit of human placental succinate dehydrogenase (partial sequence) that lacks this critical cysteine (Malcovati, M., Marchetti, T., Zanelli, T., and Tenchini, M. L. (1991) in Flavins and Flavoproteins 1990 (Curti, B., Ronchi, S., and Zanetti, G., eds) pp. 727-730, Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin) has only 16% homology to the bovine heart flavoprotein subunit. However, we show that the enzyme from human placenta is as sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide as that from bovine tissues. In addition, a transcript in human placenta and muscle hybridizes to the bovine heart flavoprotein cDNA and is the same size as that in bovine tissues.
23019358	Fumarate and nitrate reduction (FNR) regulatory proteins are O(2)-sensing bacterial transcription factors that control the switch between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. Under anaerobic conditions [4Fe-4S](2+)-FNR exists as a DNA-binding homodimer. In response to elevated oxygen levels, the [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster undergoes a rapid conversion to a [2Fe-2S](2+) cluster, resulting in a dimer-to-monomer transition and loss of site-specific DNA binding. In this work, resonance Raman and UV-visible absorption/CD spectroscopies and MS were used to characterize the interconversion between [4Fe-4S](2+) and [2Fe-2S](2+) clusters in Escherichia coli FNR. Selective (34)S labeling of the bridging sulfides in the [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster-bound form of FNR facilitated identification of resonantly enhanced Cys(32)S-(34)S stretching modes in the resonance Raman spectrum of the O(2)-exposed [2Fe-2S](2+) cluster-bound form of FNR. This result indicates O(2)-induced oxidation and retention of bridging sulfides in the form of [2Fe-2S](2+) cluster-bound cysteine persulfides. MS also demonstrates that multiple cysteine persulfides are formed on O(2) exposure of [4Fe-4S](2+)-FNR. The [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster in FNR can also be regenerated from the cysteine persulfide-coordinated [2Fe-2S](2+) cluster by anaerobic incubation with DTT and Fe(2+) ion in the absence of exogenous sulfide. Resonance Raman data indicate that this type of cluster conversion involving sulfide oxidation is not unique to FNR, because it also occurs in O(2)-exposed forms of O(2)-sensitive [4Fe-4S] clusters in radical S-adenosylmethionine enzymes. The results provide fresh insight into the molecular mechanism of O(2) sensing by FNR and iron-sulfur cluster conversion reactions in general, and suggest unique mechanisms for the assembly or repair of biological [4Fe-4S] clusters.
25449835	Redox homeostasis is essential for normal function of cells and redox imbalance has been recognised as a pathogenic factor of numerous human diseases. Oxidative modifications of cysteine thiols modulate function of many proteins, mediate signalling, and fine-tune transcriptional and metabolic processes. In this study we present the SNO/SOH TMT strategy, which enables simultaneous analysis of two different types of cysteine modification: S-nitrosylation (SNO) and S-sulfenylation (SOH). The method facilitates quantitation of modification changes corrected by changes in protein abundance levels and estimation of relative modification site occupancy in a single nLC-MSMS run. The approach was evaluated in vivo using an Escherichia coli based model of mild oxidative stress. Bacteria were grown anaerobically on fumarate or nitrate. Short-term treatment with sub-millimolar levels of hydrogen peroxide was used to induce SOH. We have identified and quantified 114 SNO and SOH modified peptides. In many instances SNO and SOH occupy the same site, suggesting an association between them. High site occupancy does not equate to a site of modification which responds to redox imbalance. The SNO/SOH TMT strategy is a viable alternative to existing methods for cysteine oxidation analysis and provides new features that will facilitate our understanding of the interplay between SNO and SOH.
30885957	Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a prescribed treatment for multiple sclerosis and has also been used to treat psoriasis. The electrophilicity of DMF suggests that its immunosuppressive activity is related to the covalent modification of cysteine residues in the human proteome. Nonetheless, our understanding of the proteins modified by DMF in human immune cells and the functional consequences of these reactions remains incomplete. In this study, we report that DMF inhibits human plasmacytoid dendritic cell function through a mechanism of action that is independent of the major electrophile sensor NRF2. Using chemical proteomics, we instead identify cysteine 13 of the innate immune kinase IRAK4 as a principal cellular target of DMF. We show that DMF blocks IRAK4-MyD88 interactions and IRAK4-mediated cytokine production in a cysteine 13-dependent manner. Our studies thus identify a proteomic hotspot for DMF action that constitutes a druggable protein-protein interface crucial for initiating innate immune responses.
2248796	Bacteria which can grow in different environments have developed regulatory systems which allow them to exploit specific habitats to their best advantage. In the facultative anaerobe Escherichia coli two transcriptional regulators controlling independent networks of oxygen-regulated gene expression have been identified. One is a two-component sensor-regulator system (ArcB-A), which represses a wide variety of aerobic enzymes under anaerobic conditions. The other is FNR, the transcriptional regulator which is essential for expressing anaerobic respiratory processes. The purpose of this review is to summarize what is known about FNR. The fnr gene was initially defined by the isolation of some pleiotropic mutants which characteristically lacked the ability to use fumarate and nitrate as reducible substrates for supporting anaerobic growth and several other anaerobic respiratory functions. Its role as a transcriptional regulator emerged from genetic and molecular studies in which its homology with CRP (the cyclic AMP receptor protein which mediates catabolite repression) was established and has since been particularly important in identifying the structural basis of its regulatory specificities. FNR is a member of a growing family of CRP-related regulatory proteins which have a DNA-binding domain based on the helix-turn-helix structural motif, and a characteristic beta-roll that is involved in nucleotide-binding in CRP. The FNR protein has been isolated in a monomeric form (Mr 30,000) which exhibits a high but as yet non-specific affinity for DNA. Nevertheless, the DNA-recognition site and important residues conferring the functional specificity of FNR have been defined by site-directed mutagenesis. A consensus for the sequences that are recognized by FNR in the promoter regions of FNR-regulated genes, has likewise been identified. The basic features of the genes and operons regulated by FNR are reviewed, and examples in which FNR functions negatively as an anaerobic repressor as well as positively as an anaerobic activator, are included. Less is known about the way in which FNR senses anoxia and is thereby transformed into its 'active' form, but it seems likely that cysteine residues and possibly a metal ion are involved. Four of the five cysteine residues of FNR are clustered in an essential N-terminal 'domain' which is conserved in FNR and the HlyX protein of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, but not in CRP or the FixK protein of Rhizobium meliloti. The relationships between FNR and other oxygen-related systems in E. coli are discussed, as well as parallel systems in other organisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3717948	Purified and membrane-bound succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) from bovine heart mitochondria was inhibited by the histidine-modifying reagents ethoxyformic anhydride (EFA) and Rose Bengal in the presence of light. Succinate and competitive inhibitors protected against inhibition, and decreased the number of histidyl residues modified by EFA. The essential residue modified by EFA was not the essential thiol of SDH, but modification of the essential thiol abolished the protective effect of malonate against inhibition of SDH by EFA. The EFA inhibition was reversed by hydroxylamine nearly completely when the inhibition was less than or equal to 35%, and only partially when the inhibition was more extensive. The uv spectrum of EFA-modified SDH before and after hydroxylamine treatment suggested that extensive inhibition of SDH with EFA may result in ethoxyformylation at both imidazole nitrogens of histidyl residues. Such a modification is not reversed by hydroxylamine. Succinate dehydrogenases and fumarate reductases from several different sources have similar compositions, and the two enzymes from Escherichia coli have considerable homology in the amino acid composition of their respective flavoprotein and iron-sulfur protein subunits. In the former, there is a short stretch containing conserved histidine, cysteine, and arginine residues. These residues, if also conserved in the bovine enzyme, may be the essential active site residues suggested by this work (histidine) and previously (cysteine, arginine).
4953779	1. Filtrates from cultures of a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, grown in a basal glucose-ammonium chloride-vitamins-salts medium, possessed biotin activity as detected by microbiological assays. Exponential-phase culture filtrates contained biotin and desthiobiotin in the approximate ratio 1:3, with smaller amounts of biotin sulphoxide and three unidentified compounds with biotin activity. 2. The addition of malonate, adipate or pimelate to the basal medium stimulated the production of compounds with biotin activity; this effect was enhanced when these compounds were included in the medium as the major carbon source. Succinate, glutarate, suberate, fumarate or oxaloacetate did not stimulate the production of compounds with biotin activity. The ratio of biotin to desthiobiotin in filtrates from cultures grown in medium containing malonate as the carbon source was about 1:1. Experiments in which mixtures of malonate and pimelate were included in the medium as the carbon sources showed that these acids probably make a similar contribution in biotin biosynthesis. 3. A number of heterocyclic compounds, including several containing the ureido group (-NH-CO-NH-), were included in the basal medium but none of them stimulated the production of compounds with biotin activity to any marked degree. 4. Several amino acids, particularly cysteine (or cystine) and lysine, when added individually as supplements to the basal medium, stimulated the production of compounds with biotin activity. Filtrates from cultures grown in medium supplemented with cysteine contained approximately equal proportions of biotin and desthiobiotin. A much greater stimulation in the production of compounds with biotin activity was obtained when certain amino acids were included in the medium as the major source of nitrogen or carbon and nitrogen; ornithine, citrulline and argininosuccinate had the most marked effect. The ratio of biotin to desthiobiotin in filtrates from these cultures was usually greater than in filtrates from cultures grown in basal medium. 5-Aminovalerate also caused some stimulation when used as the nitrogen source, but urea was inactive. The effect of binary mixtures of certain amino acids was also examined. 5. The results are discussed in relation to the possible role of the stimulatory compounds during biotin biosynthesis.
10903516	The oxygen sensor regulator FNR (fumarate nitrate reductase regulator) of Escherichia coli is known to be inactivated by O2 as the result of conversion of a [4Fe-4S] cluster of the protein into a [2Fe-2S] cluster. Further incubation with O2 causes loss of the [2Fe-2S] cluster and production of apoFNR. The reactions involved in cluster assembly and reductive activation of apoFNR isolated under anaerobic or aerobic conditions were studied in vivo and in vitro. In a gshA mutant of E. coli that was completely devoid of glutathione, the O2 tension for the regulatory switch for FNR-dependent gene regulation was decreased by a factor of 4-5 compared with the wild-type, suggesting a role for glutathione in FNR function. In isolated apoFNR, glutathione could be used as the reducing agent for HS- formation required for [4Fe-4S] assembly by cysteine desulfurase (NifS), and for the reduction of cysteine ligands of the FeS cluster in FNR. Air-inactivated FNR (apoFNR without FeS) could be reconstituted to [4Fe-4S].FNR by the same reaction as used for apoFNR isolated under anaerobic conditions. The in vivo effects of glutathione on FNR function and the role of glutathione in the formation of active [4Fe-4S].FNR in vitro suggest an important role for glutathione in the de novo assembly of FNR and in the reductive activation of air-oxidized FNR under anaerobic conditions.
12896992	The Neisseria gonorrhoeae genome encodes a homologue of the Escherichia coli FNR protein (the fumarate and nitrate reductase regulator). Despite its similarity to E. coli FNR, the gonococcal FNR only partially complemented an E. coli fnr mutation. After error-prone PCR mutagenesis of the gonococcal fnr gene, we identified four mutant fnr derivatives carrying the same S18F substitution, and we showed that the mutant FNR could activate transcription from a range of class I and class II FNR-dependent promoters in E. coli. Prompted by the similarities between gonococcal and E. coli FNR, we made changes in gonococcal fnr that created substitutions that are equivalent to previously characterized substitutions in E. coli FNR. First, our experiments showed that cysteine, C116, in the gonococcal FNR, equivalent to C122 in E. coli FNR, is essential, presumably because, as in E. coli FNR, it binds to an iron-sulfur center. Second, the L22H and D148A substitutions in gonococcal FNR were made. These changes are equivalent to the L28H and D154A changes in E. coli FNR, which had been shown to increase FNR activity in the presence of oxygen. We show that the effects of these substitutions in gonococcal FNR are distinct from those of the S18F substitution. Similarly, substitutions in the putative activating regions of gonococcal FNR were made. We show that the activity of gonococcal FNR in E. coli can be increased by transplanting certain activating regions from E. coli FNR. The effects of these substitutions are additive to those due to S18F. From these data, we conclude that the effects of the S18F substitution in gonococcal FNR are distinct from the effects of the other substitutions. S18 is immediately adjacent to one of three N-terminal cysteine residues that coordinate the iron-sulfur center, and thus the S18F substitution is most likely to stabilize this center. Support for this came from complementary experiments in which we created the S24F substitution in E. coli FNR, which is equivalent to the S18F substitution in gonococcal FNR. Our results show that the S24F substitution changes the activity of E. coli FNR and that the changes are distinct from those due to previously characterized substitutions.
23596207	Fe4S4 clusters are very common versatile prosthetic groups in proteins. Their redox property of being sensitive to O2-induced oxidative damage is, for instance, used by the cell to sense oxygen levels and switch between aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms, as exemplified by the fumarate, nitrate reduction regulator (FNR). Using the hydrogenase maturase HydE from Thermotoga maritima as a template, we obtained several unusual forms of FeS clusters, some of which are associated with important structural changes. These structures represent intermediate states relevant to both FeS cluster assembly and degradation. We observe one Fe2S2 cluster bound by two cysteine persulfide residues. This observation lends structural support to a very recent Raman study, which reported that Fe4S4-to-Fe2S2 cluster conversion upon oxygen exposure in FNR resulted in concomitant production of cysteine persulfide as cluster ligands. Similar persulfide ligands have been observed in vitro for several other Fe4S4 cluster-containing proteins. We have also monitored FeS cluster conversion directly in our protein crystals. Our structures indicate that the Fe4S4-to-Fe2S2 change requires large structural modifications, which are most likely responsible for the dimer-monomer transition in FNR.
26589354	The adduction of fumaric acid to the sulfhydryl group of certain cysteine (Cys) residues in proteins via a Michael-like reaction leads to the formation of S-(2-succino)cysteine (2SC) sites. Although its role remains to be fully understood, this post-translational Cys modification (protein succination) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes/obesity and fumarate hydratase-related diseases. In this study, theoretical approaches to address sequence- and 3D-structure-based features possibly underlying the specificity of protein succination have been applied to perform the first analysis of the available data on the succinate proteome. A total of 182 succinated proteins, 205 modifiable, and 1750 non-modifiable sites have been examined. The rate of 2SC sites per protein ranged from 1 to 3, and the overall relative abundance of modifiable sites was 10.8%. Modifiable and non-modifiable sites were not distinguishable when the hydrophobicity of the Cys-flaking peptides, the acid dissociation constant value of the sulfhydryl groups, and the secondary structure of the Cys-containing segments were compared. By contrast, significant differences were determined when the accessibility of the sulphur atoms and the amino acid composition of the Cys-flaking peptides were analysed. Based on these findings, a sequence-based score function has been evaluated as a descriptor for Cys residues. In conclusion, our results indicate that modifiable and non-modifiable sites form heterogeneous subsets when features often discussed to describe Cys reactivity are examined. However, they also suggest that some differences exist, which may constitute the baseline for further investigations aimed at the development of predictive methods for 2SC sites in proteins.
29044950	Arginine biosynthesis pathway is crucial to the survival and pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Arginine is a critical amino acid that contributes to the inflection of cellular immune responses during pathogenesis. Argininosuccinate lyase from Mtb (MtArgH), the last enzyme in the pathway, catalyzes the production of arginine from argininosuccinic acid. MtArgH is an essential enzyme for the growth and survival of M. tuberculosis. We biochemically characterized MtArgH and deciphered the role of a previously unexplored cysteine (Cys441 ) residue at the C-terminal region of the protein. Chemical modification of Cys441 completely abrogated the enzymatic activity suggesting its involvement in the catalytic mechanism. Replacement of Cys441 to alanine showed a striking decrease in the enzymatic activity, while retaining the overall secondary to quaternary structure of the protein, hence corroborating the involvement of Cys441 in the process of catalysis. Interestingly, replacement of Cys441 to serine, showed significant increase in activity, as compared to the wild-type MtArgH. Inactivity of C441 A and elevated activity of its conservative mutant (C441 S) confirmed the participation of Cys441 in the MtArgH activity. We also, observed that C441 S mutant has higher thermal stability and maintains significant activity at high temperatures. This is in concordance with our observation that Cys441 in Mtb is replaced by a serine in the ArgH from thermophilic microorganisms. Furthermore, we also propose a potential feedback mechanism, wherein the Cys441 is covalently modified to S-(2-succinyl) cysteine (succination) by one of the products, fumarate, thereby inactivating MtArgH. These insights into the mechanism of MtArgH activity unravel novel regulations of arginine biosynthetic pathway in Mtb.  2017 IUBMB Life, 69(11):896-907, 2017.
29208641	The cyanide-insensitive alternative oxidase (AOX) is a non-proton-pumping ubiquinol oxidase that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water and is posttranslationally regulated by redox mechanisms and 2-oxo acids. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) possesses five AOX isoforms (AOX1A-AOX1D and AOX2). AOX1D expression is increased in aox1a knockout mutants from Arabidopsis (especially after restriction of the cytochrome c pathway) but cannot compensate for the lack of AOX1A, suggesting a difference in the regulation of these isoforms. Therefore, we analyzed the different AOX isoenzymes with the aim to identify differences in their posttranslational regulation. Seven tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (citrate, isocitrate, 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate) were tested for their influence on AOX1A, AOX1C, and AOX1D wild-type protein activity using a refined in vitro system. AOX1C is insensitive to all seven organic acids, AOX1A and AOX1D are both activated by 2-oxoglutarate, but only AOX1A is additionally activated by oxaloacetate. Furthermore, AOX isoforms cannot be transformed to mimic one another by substituting the variable cysteine residues at position III in the protein. In summary, we show that AOX isoforms from Arabidopsis are differentially fine-regulated by tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites (most likely depending on the amino-terminal region around the highly conserved cysteine residues known to be involved in regulation by the 2-oxo acids pyruvate and glyoxylate) and propose that this is the main reason why they cannot functionally compensate for each other.
32919375	Airway obstruction (AO) is associated with hypoxemia, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. These conditions can favor the formation of Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) and induce mitochondrial stress. The latter can alter metabolite intermediates in the Krebs cycle leading to the formation of the cysteine-fumarate adduct S-(2-succino) cysteine (2SC) in proteins (protein succination). Protein succination has not been described in airways diseases.
33096789	Experimental evidence highlights nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) as a molecular target in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The well-known effect of electrophilic cysteine-reactive skin allergens on Nrf2-activation led to the hypothesis that these compounds could have a therapeutic role in AD. This was further supported by the neuroprotective activity of the skin allergen dimethyl fumarate (DMF), demonstrated in in vivo models of neurodegenerative diseases. We evaluated the effect of the cysteine-reactive allergens 1,4-phenylenediamine (PPD) and methyl heptine carbonate (MHC) on (1) neuronal redox imbalance and calcium dyshomeostasis using N2a wild-type (N2a-wt) and human APP-overexpressing neuronal cells (wild-type, N2a-APPwt) and (2) on neuroinflammation, using microglia BV-2 cells exposed to LPS (lipopolysaccharide). Phthalic anhydride (PA, mainly lysine-reactive), was used as a negative control. DMF, PPD and MHC increased Hmox1 gene and HMOX1 protein levels in N2a-APPwt cells suggesting Nrf2-dependent antioxidant activity. MHC, but also PA, rescued N2a-APPwt mitochondrial membrane potential and calcium levels in a Nrf2-independent pathway. All the chemicals showed anti-inflammatory activity by decreasing iNOS protein in microglia. This work highlights the potential neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory role of the selected skin allergens in in vitro models of AD, and supports further studies envisaging the validation of the results using in vivo AD models.
33692690	Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an approved drug used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) and psoriasis therapy. Multiple studies have demonstrated other pharmacological activities of DMF such as an anti-cancer agent. In particular, studies have shown that DMF can modulate the NRF2/HO1/NQO1 antioxidant signal pathway and inactivate NF-κB to suppress the growth of colon and breast cancer cells, and induce cell death. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the anti-tumor activities of DMF in pancreatic cancer (PC) focusing on cell death as the predominant mechanism of response. We showed that both mitochondrial respiration and aerobic glycolysis were severely depressed following treatment with DMF and the effects could be abrogated by treatment with L-cysteine and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Importantly, we verified that DMF induced metabolic crisis and that cell death was not related to alterations in ROS. Our data implied that MTHFD1 could be a potential downstream target of DMF identified by molecular docking analysis. Finally, we confirmed that MTHFD1 is up-regulated in PC and overexpression of MTHFD1 was negatively related to outcomes of PC patients. Our data indicate that DMF induces metabolic crisie to suppress cell growth and could be a potential novel therapy in the treatment of PC.
35993574	Up to 40% of pheochromocytomas (PCCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs) are hereditary. Germline mutations/deletions in fumarate hydratase ( FH ) cause hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome which manifests predominantly with FH-deficient uterine/cutaneous leiomyomas and renal cell carcinomas (RCCs)-tumors characterized by loss of immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of FH and/or positive staining for S-(2-succino)-cysteine. Occasional patients develop PCC/PGL. We investigated the incidence, morphologic, and clinical features of FH-deficient PCC/PGL. We identified 589 patients with PCC/PGLs that underwent IHC screening for FH and/or S-(2-succino)-cysteine. Eight (1.4%) PCC/PGLs were FH deficient (1.1% in an unselected population). The median age for FH-deficient cases was 55 (range: 30 to 77 y) with 50% arising in the adrenal. All 4 with biochemical data were noradrenergic. Two (25%) metastasized, 1 dying of disease after 174 months. Germline testing was performed on 7 patients, 6 of whom had FH missense mutations. None were known to have a significant family history before presentation or developed cutaneous leiomyomas, or FH-deficient RCC at extended follow-up. The patient wild-type for FH on germline testing was demonstrated to have somatic FH mutation and loss of heterozygosity corresponding to areas of subclonal FH deficiency in her tumor. One patient did not undergo germline testing, but FH mutation was demonstrated in his tumor. We conclude that FH-deficient PCC/PGL are underrecognized but can be identified by IHC. FH-deficient PCC/PGL are strongly associated with germline missense mutations but are infrequently associated with leiomyoma or RCC, suggesting there may be a genotype-phenotype correlation. FH-deficient PCC/PGL may have a higher metastatic risk.
1451685	Homology probing by using mixed primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a subsequent sequence analysis by automated DNA sequencer were applied to determine a partial cDNA sequence of the iron-sulfur subunit of complex II (succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase). Complex II is a membrane-bound flavoenzyme, which catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and it is a component of the mitochondrial and bacterial respiratory chains. In this study, the partial amino acid sequence of iron-sulfur subunits in Caenorhabditis elegans mitochondria was deduced from the DNA sequence obtained from cDNA-PCR. Mixed oligonucleotide primers corresponding to two conserved regions which appear to be the binding site for the prosthetic group were used. The product of PCR was cloned into plasmid vector pUC 119 and the sequence was determined from double strand plasmid DNA by the dideoxy method using of one-dye, four-lane type the automated DNA sequencer (DSQ-1, Shimadzu). The PCR product contained 483 nucleotides and its deduced amino acid sequence was highly homologous with that in human liver (68.9%) and that of Escherichia coli sdh B product (50.3%). As expected, striking sequence conservation was found around the three cysteine-rich clusters which have been thought to comprise the iron-sulfur centers of the enzyme.
1907852	We investigated oxygen equilibrium properties of highly purified human adult hemoglobin cross-linked between lysine-82 beta 1 and lysine-82 beta 2 by a fumaryl group, which is prepared by reaction of the CO form with bis(3,5-dibromosalicyl) fumarate. The cross-linked hemoglobin preparation isolated by the previous purification method, namely, gel filtration in the presence of 1 M MgCl2 followed by ion-exchange chromatography, was found to be contaminated with about 20% of an electrophoretically silent impurity that shows remarkably high affinity for oxygen. This impurity was separated from the desired cross-linked hemoglobin by a newly developed purification method, which utilizes a difference between the authentic hemoglobin and the impurity in reactivity of the sulfhydryl groups of cysteine-93 beta toward N-ethylmaleimide under a deoxygenated condition. After this purification procedure, the oxygen equilibrium properties of purified cross-linked hemoglobin in the absence of organic phosphate became very similar to those of unmodified hemoglobin with respect to oxygen affinity, cooperativity, and the alkaline Bohr effect. The functional similarity between the cross-linked hemoglobin and unmodified hemoglobin allows us to utilize this cross-linking for preparing asymmetric hybrid hemoglobin tetramers, which are particularly useful as intermediately liganded models. Previous studies on this type of cross-linked hemoglobin should be subject to reexamination due to the considerable amount of the impurity.
2187483	Quinolinic acid is synthesized in E. coli by the enzymes L-aspartate oxidase and quinolinate synthase A, the genes of which are named nadB and nadA. In our previous work we cloned and characterized the two genes (Flachmann, R., Kunz, N., Seifert, J., Gütlich, M., Wientjes, F.J., Läufer, A. & Gassen, H.G. (1988) Eur. J. Biochem. 175, 221-228). Here we report on the expression of the nadB gene under control of the inducible left promoter of the bacteriophage lambda. The yield of the active gene product L-aspartate oxidase was enhanced up to 20% of the soluble cell protein. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity in a three-step procedure and the reading frame of the L-aspartate oxidase gene was confirmed by Edman degradation of five cyanogen bromide peptides. L-Aspartate oxidase shows no classical Michaelis-Menten behaviour but is subject to a substrate inactivation. The apparent Km values were different for substrate concentrations below and above 1mM and were determined to 0.5 mM and 4.1mM, respectively. The active form of the enzyme is a monomer of 60,284 Da and contains one molecule of FAD and nine cysteine residues, four of which built up two disulfide bonds. The isoelectric point of the protein was determined to be at pH 5.6. Chemical modifications of the enzyme showed that at least one tyrosine and one histidine residue are essential for enzyme activity. The coenzyme-binding domain is located in the amino-terminal part of the polypeptide chain as revealed by a sequence comparison to other dinucleotide binding enzymes. Furthermore, there is evidence for a relationship to fumarate reductase and succinate dehydrogenase of E. coli.
2229038	"The fnr gene product, FNR, is a global regulator of anaerobic gene expression in Escherichia coli. When E. coli is switched from aerobic to anaerobic growth conditions, cytochrome o (cyoABCDE) and d oxidase (cydAB) genes are repressed and the anaerobic terminal reductase genes, including nitrate (narGHJI), dimethyl sulfoxide/trimethylamine (dmsABC), and fumarate (frdABCD) reductase, are induced. To determine if certain amino acid residues are essential for FNR to function in this regulatory process, site-directed mutations were introduced into the fnr gene. The resulting mutant proteins were assayed in vivo for their ability to either activate dmsA'-'lacZ and frdA'-'lacZ gene expression, or repress expression of a cyoA'-'lacZ gene fusion. The fnr mutants were grouped into four classes. Class I exhibited a severe decrease in the ability to either activate or repress fnr-dependent gene expression. Mutations in four of the five cysteine residues in the FNR protein were in this class. The sole exception was an FNR Cys16----Ser ""mutant"""" that exhibited normal activity. Class II mutations caused a mild reduction in FNR-dependent activation or repression while Class III mutations conferred a modest increase in the ability of the FNR protein to activate gene expression under aerobic conditions (i.e. FNR*). Finally"
2656658	The nucleotide sequence of a 3,162-base-pair (bp) segment of DNA containing the FNR-regulated fumB gene, which encodes the anaerobic class I fumarase (FUMB) of Escherichia coli, was determined. The structural gene was found to comprise 1,641 bp, 547 codons (excluding the initiation and termination codons), and the gene product had a predicted Mr of 59,956. The amino acid sequence of FUMB contained the same number of residues as did that of the aerobic class I fumarase (FUMA), and there were identical amino acids at all but 56 positions (89.8% identity). There was no significant similarity between the class I fumarases and the class II enzyme (FUMC) except in one region containing the following consensus: Gly-Ser-Xxx-Ile-Met-Xxx-Xxx-Lys-Xxx-Asn. Some of the 56 amino acid substitutions must be responsible for the functional preferences of the enzymes for malate dehydration (FUMB) and fumarate hydration (FUMA). Significant similarities between the cysteine-containing sequence of the class I fumarases (FUMA and FUMB) and the mammalian aconitases were detected, and this finding further supports the view that these enzymes are all members of a family of iron-containing hydrolyases. The nucleotide sequence of a 1,142-bp distal sequence of an unidentified gene (genF) located upstream of fumB was also defined and found to encode a product that is homologous to the product of another unidentified gene (genA), located downstream of the neighboring aspartase gene (aspA).
3372020	The chemotactic behavior of Campylobacter jejuni was determined in the presence of different amino acids, carbohydrates, organic acids, and preparations and constituents of mucin and bile. L-Fucose was the only carbohydrate and L-aspartate, L-cysteine, L-glutamate, and L-serine were the only amino acids producing a chemotactic (positive) response. Several salts of organic acids, including pyruvate, succinate, fumarate, citrate, malate, and alpha-ketoglutarate, were also chemoattractants, as were bile (beef, chicken, and oxgall) and mucin (bovine gallbladder and hog gastric). Most constituents of bile tested individually were chemorepellents, but the mucin component was chemoattractant. The chemotactic behavior of C. jejuni toward L-fucose, a constituent of both bile and mucin, may be an important factor in the affinity of the organism for the gallbladder and intestinal tract.
5801668	1. Argininosuccinate lyase (EC 4.3.2.1) from jack bean [Canavalia ensiformis (L.) DC] seeds was purified 532-fold from an acetone-butanol-dried powder. 2. The enzyme functions reversibly and exhibits maximum stability at 16 degrees . 3. At 16 degrees it has a half-life (t((1/2))) of 263min. 4. The enzyme is both cold-labile (t((1/2)) 131min. at 0 degrees ) and heat-inactivated (t((1/2)) 74min. at 38 degrees ); inactivation appears to be irreversible. 5. Treatment of the acetone-butanol-extracted powder with sodium dodecyl sulphate increased the sensitivity of the enzyme to temperature (t((1/2)) 70min. at 0 degrees ; t((1/2)) 23min. at 38 degrees ). 6. Addition, to the purified enzyme, of a fraction containing lipid from the seed increased the half-life to about 510min. at either 0 degrees or 38 degrees . 7. Arginine or homoarginine, and to a smaller extent some other amino acids or fumarate, protected the enzyme from cold-inactivation. 8. Reactivation attempts with both the cold- and heat-inactivated enzyme failed. 9. The K(m) value for argininosuccinate at pH7.5 is 1.3x10(-4). 10. The enzyme was inactivated completely within 15min. at 16 degrees by 0.5mm-p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and subsequent exposure to 5mm-cysteine had no restorative effect.
6388571	The nucleotide sequence of a 961 base-pair segment of DNA containing the sdhB gene, which encodes the iron-sulphur protein subunit of the E. coli succinate dehydrogenase, has been determined. The sdhB structural gene comprises 711 base pairs (237 codons, excluding the translational initiator and terminator). It is separated by a 15 base-pair intergenic region from the preceding flavoprotein gene (sdhA) and is the distal gene of an operon that also includes genes (sdhC and D) encoding two hydrophobic subunits, sdhCDAB. The distal end of the sdh operon is linked to the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase gene (sucA) by a complex region of dyad symmetry that is homologous with several potential intercistronic regulatory elements or transcriptional attenuators. The sdhB structural gene encodes a polypeptide of Mr26637 that is strikingly homologous with the iron-sulphur protein subunit of fumarate reductase (38% identity, increasing to 58% when conservative changes are included). Both subunits contain 11 cysteine residues, 10 being conserved in three clusters resembling those found in ferredoxins. This work completes the sequence of a 9897 base-pair segment of DNA containing seven tricarboxylic acid cycle genes encoding three enzymes or enzyme complexes, citrate synthase (gltA), succinate dehydrogenase (sdh), and the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (suc), that are organized thus: gltA-sdhCDAB-sucAB.
6524153	Campylobacter jejuni/coli strains were isolated from the faeces of 240 patients suffering from acute enteritis. The following characteristics were investigated: (i) growth at different temperatures, and on different substrates under either microaerophilic conditions or anaerobically, with fumarate or nitrate as terminal electron acceptors; (ii) production of H2S in cysteine-containing broth; (iii) hydrolysis of hippuric acid; (iv) DNase; (v) alkaline phosphatase; (vi) beta-lactamase; (vii) presence of menaquinone; and (viii) reduction of selenite. Based on characteristics (ii)-(v), the strains could be divided in 9 phenotypical groups. Most of the strains represented group 2 (DNase+, H2S+, hippurate hydrolysis+, alk. phosphatase-) (32%), and groups 8 (DNase-, H2S+, hippurate hydrolysis+, alk. phosphatase-) (32%). The other groups were of minor importance. On the other hand, most of the isolates from the United States (Weaver, 1981) fitted well into group 1 (DNase+, H2S+, hippurate hydrolysis+, alk. phosphatase+) which might demonstrate geographical variations among C. jejuni/coli.
6830817	Modification of pig heart fumarase (L-malate hydro-lyase, EC 4.2.1.2) with tetranitromethane results in loss of enzymatic activity. The inactivation is slowed down in the presence of substrates, indicating that the modification reaction takes place at the level of the substrate binding sites. From these inactivation kinetics, a value Kd = 78 microM is calculated for the mixture of substrates (L-malate + fumarate). This is in fairly good agreement with the Michaelis constant Km = 31 microM. Spectrophotometric data indicate that modification of one tyrosine residue per fumarase subunit is responsible for the inactivation; one or more additional residues, which do not participate in the binding sites, are modified at much lower rates. Amino acid analyses confirm the presence of nitrotyrosine and exclude the possibility of tetranitromethane-mediated polymerization side-reactions. It is concluded from the pH-dependence of the nitration reaction that the inactivation of fumarase is not caused by cysteine modification. Additional studies of nitration of melittin, a tryptophan-containing model peptide, are described. From the absorption spectra of modified melittin, in comparison with the spectra of nitrofumarase, it is concluded that the tryptophan residues of the latter enzyme remain intact during the reaction with tetranitromethane. Finally, evidence is given for an independent action of the four fumarase subunits, i.e., inactivation of one subunit does not influence the catalysis by the other three subunits. Moreover, it is shown that only fumarase tetramers with all four subunits nitrated are unable to bind to a Sepharose-pyromellitic acid affinity column.
8081492	Adenylylsulphate (adenosine-5'-phosphosulphate, APS) reductase from the extremely thermophilic sulphate-reducing archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus is an iron-sulphur flavoprotein containing one non-covalently bound flavin group, eight non-haem iron and six labile sulphide atoms per molecule. Reevaluation of the enzyme structure revealed the presence of two different subunits with molecular masses of 80 and 18.5 kDa. The subunits are arranged in an alpha 2 beta subunit structure. We have cloned and sequenced a 2.7 kb segment of DNA containing the genes for the alpha and beta subunits, which we designate aprA and aprB, respectively. The two genes are separated by 17 bp and localized in the order aprBA. While a putative promoter could not be identified in the vicinity of aprBA a probable termination signal was found just downstream of the translation stop codon of aprA. The codon usage for aprBA shows strong preferences for G and C in the third codon position. aprA encodes a 73.3 kDa polypeptide, which shows significant overall similarities with the flavoprotein subunits of the succinate dehydrogenases from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and the corresponding flavoprotein of E. coli fumarate reductase. Part of the homologous peptide stretches could be assigned to domains that are involved in the binding of the substrate or of the FAD prosthetic group. aprB encodes a 17.1 kDa polypeptide representing an iron-sulphur protein, seven cysteine residues of which are arranged in two clusters typical of ligands of the iron-sulphur centres in ([Fe3S4][Fe4S4]) 7-Fe ferredoxins.
8253682	An electron transport regulatory gene, etrA, has been isolated and characterized from the obligate respiratory bacterium Shewanella putrefaciens MR-1. The deduced amino acid sequence of etrA (EtrA) shows a high degree of identity to both the Fnr of Escherichia coli (73.6%) and the analogous protein (ANR) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (50.8%). The four active cysteine residues of Fnr are conserved in EtrA, and the amino acid sequence of the DNA-binding domains of the two proteins are identical. Further, S. putrefaciens etrA is able to complement an fnr mutant of E. coli. In contrast to fnr, there is no recognizable Fnr box upstream of the etrA sequence. Gene replacement etrA mutants of MR-1 were deficient in growth on nitrite, thiosulfate, sulfite, trimethylamine-N-oxide, dimethyl sulfoxide, Fe(III), and fumarate, suggesting that EtrA is involved in the regulation of the corresponding reductase genes. However, the mutants were all positive for reduction of and growth on nitrate and Mn(IV), indicating that EtrA is not involved in the regulation of these two systems. Southern blots of S. putrefaciens DNA with use of etrA as a probe revealed the expected etrA bands and a second set of hybridization signals whose genetic and functional properties remain to be determined.
9287013	The sdh operon of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius DSM 639 is composed of four genes coding for the 63.1-kDa flavoprotein (SdhA), the 36.5-kDa iron-sulfur protein (SdhB), and the 32.1-kDa SdhC and 14.1-kDa SdhD subunits. The four structural genes of the sdhABCD operon are transcribed into one polycistronic mRNA of 4.2 kb, and the transcription start was determined by the primer extension method to correspond with the first base of the ATG start codon of the sdhA gene. The S. acidocaldarius SdhA and SdhB subunits show characteristic sequence similarities to the succinate dehydrogenases and fumarate reductases of other organisms, while the SdhC and SdhD subunits, thought to form the membrane-anchoring domain, lack typical transmembrane alpha-helical regions present in all other succinate:quinone reductases (SQRs) and quinol:ifumarate reductases (QFRs) so far examined. Moreover, the SdhC subunit reveals remarkable 30% sequence similarity to the heterodisulfide reductase B subunit of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and Methanococcus jannaschii, containing all 10 conserved cysteine residues. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic studies of the purified enzyme as well as of membranes revealed the presence of typical S1 [2Fe2S] and S2 [4Fe4S] clusters, congruent with the deduced amino acid sequences. In contrast, EPR signals for a typical S3 [3Fe4S] cluster were not detected. However, EPR data together with sequence information implicate the existence of a second [4Fe4S] cluster in S. acidocaldarius rather than a typical [3Fe4S] cluster. These results and the fact that the S. acidocaldarius succinate dehydrogenase complex reveals only poor activity with caldariella quinone clearly suggest a unique structure for the SQR of S. acidocaldarius, possibly involving an electron transport pathway from the enzyme complex into the respiratory chain different from those for known SQRs and QFRs.
9642208	In the facultatively anaerobic bacterium Bacillus licheniformis a gene encoding a protein of the fumarate nitrate reductase family of transcriptional regulators (Fnr) was isolated. Unlike Fnr proteins from gram-negative bacteria, but like Fnr from Bacillus subtilis, the protein contained a C-terminal cluster of cysteine residues. Unlike in Fnr from B. subtilis, this cluster (Cys226-X2-Cys229-X4-Cys234) is composed of only three Cys residues, which are supposed to serve together with an internal residue (Cys71) as the ligands for an FeS center. Transfer of the B. licheniformis gene to an fnr mutant of B. subtilis complemented the ability for synthesis of nitrate reductase during anaerobic growth.
9732447	A new halotolerant Desulfovibrio, strain CVLT (T = type strain), was isolated from a solar saltern in California. The curved, gram-negative, nonsporeforming cells (0.3 x 1.0-1.3 m) occurred singly, in pairs, or in chains, were motile by a single polar flagellum and tolerated up to 12.5% NaCl. Strain CVLT had a generation time of 60 min when grown in lactate-yeast extract medium under optimal conditions (37 degreesC, pH 7.6, 2.5% NaCl). It used lactate, pyruvate, cysteine, or H2/CO2 + acetate as electron donors, and sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, or fumarate as electron acceptors. Elemental sulfur, nitrate, or oxygen were not used. Sulfite and thiosulfate were disproportionated to sulfate and sulfide. The G+C content of the DNA was 62 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Desulfovibrio fructosovorans was the nearest relative. Strain CVLT is clearly different from other Desulfovibrio species, and is designated Desulfovibrio senezii sp. nov. (DSM 8436).
9924817	A mesophilic strain of sulfate-reducing bacterium, designated ALA-3T (T = type strain), was isolated from an anaerobic lagoon of a dairy wastewater treatment plant. The curved, Gram-negative, non-sporeforming cells (0.2 x 3.0-4.0 microns) existed singly or in chains, and were motile by single polar flagella. Optimum growth occurred at 35 degrees C and pH 7.5 on a medium containing lactate and sulfate. Thiosulfate or sulfite but not elemental sulfur, nitrate, or fumarate could also replace sulfate as an electron acceptor. Formate, alanine, aspartate, leucine, isoleucine, valine, and methionine, H2/CO2 and ethanol also served as electron donors with sulfate as an electron acceptor. Pyruvate, casamino acids, peptone, serine, glycine, cysteine and threonine were fermented. Sulfite and thiosulfate were disproportionated to sulfate and sulfide. The G + C content of the DNA was 66 mol % G + C. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Desulfovibrio africanus was the nearest relative (similarity of 89%). Strain ALA-3T is physiologically and phylogenetically different from other Desulfovibrio species, and is designated Desulfovibrio aminophilus sp. nov. (DSM 12254).
10480267	The use of the redox dye 5-cyano-2,3,-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) for evaluating the metabolic activity of aerobic bacteria has gained wide application in recent years. In this study, we examined the utility of CTC in capturing the metabolic activity of anaerobic bacteria. In addition, the factors contributing to abiotic reduction of CTC were also examined. CTC was used in conjunction with the fluorochrome 5-(4,6-dichlorotriazinyl) aminofluorescein (DTAF), that targets bacterial cell wall proteins, to quantitate the active fraction of total bacterial numbers. Facultative anaerobic bacteria, including Escherichia coli grown fermentatively, and Pseudomonas chlorophis, P. fluorescens, P. stutzeri, and P. pseudoalcalegenes subsp. pseudoalcalegenes grown under nitrate-reducing conditions, actively reduced CTC during all phases of growth. Greater than 95% of these cells accumulated intracellular CTC-formazan crystals during the exponential phase. Obligate anaerobic bacteria, including Syntrophus aciditrophicus grown fermentatively, Geobacter sulfurreducens grown with fumarate as the electron acceptor, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans and D. halophilus grown under sulfate-reducing conditions, Methanobacterium formicicum grown on formate, H2 and CO2, and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum grown autotrophically on H2 and CO2 all reduced CTC to intracellular CTC-formazan crystals. The optimal CTC concentration for all organisms examined was 5 mM. Anaerobic CTC incubations were not required for quantification of anaerobically grown cells. CTC-formazan production by all cultures examined was proportional to biomass production, and CTC reduction was observed even in the absence of added nutrients. CTC was reduced by culture fluids containing ferric citrate as electron acceptor following growth of either G. metallireducens or G. sulfurreducens. Abiotic reduction of CTC was observed in the presence of ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, dithiothreitol, NADH, NADPH, Fe(II)Cl2, sodium thioglycolic acid and sodium sulfide. These results suggest that while CTC can be used to capture the metabolic activity of anaerobic bacteria, care must be taken to avoid abiotic reduction of CTC.
10692418	To understand the role of the [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster in controlling the activity of the Escherichia coli transcription factor FNR (fumarate nitrate reduction) during changes in O(2) availability, we have characterized a mutant FNR protein containing a substitution of Leu-28 with His (FNR-L28H) which, unlike its wild type (WT) counterpart, is functional under aerobic growth conditions. The His-28 substitution appears to stabilize the [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster of FNR-L28H in the presence of O(2) because air-exposed FNR-L28H did not undergo the rapid [4Fe-4S](2+) to [2Fe-2S](2+) cluster conversion or concomitant loss in site-specific DNA binding and dimerization, which are characteristic of WT-FNR under these conditions. This increased cluster stability was not a result of His-28 replacing the WT-FNR cluster ligands because substitution of any of these four Cys residues (cysteine 20, 23, 29, or 122) with Ser resulted in [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster-deficient preparations of FNR-L28H. The Mössbauer spectra of FNR-L28H indicated that the coordination environment of the [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster did not differ from that of WT-FNR. Whole cell Mössbauer spectroscopy showed that aerobically grown cells overexpressing FNR-L28H had levels of the FNR species containing the [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster similar to those of cells grown under anaerobic conditions. Thus, the increase in cluster stability is sufficient to allow accumulation of the [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster form of FNR-L28H under aerobic conditions and provides a reasonable explanation for why this mutant protein is functional under aerobic growth conditions. From these results, we present a model to explain how WT-FNR is normally inactivated under aerobic growth conditions.
10743611	Complex II of adult Ascaris suum muscle exhibits high fumarate reductase (FRD) activity and plays a key role in anaerobic electron-transport during adaptation to their microaerobic habitat. In contrast, larval (L2) complex II shows a much lower FRD activity than the adult enzyme, and functions as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in aerobic respiration. We have reported the stage-specific isoforms of complex II in A. suum mitochondria, and showed that at least the flavoprotein subunit (Fp) and the small subunit of cytochrome b (cybS) of the larval complex II differ from those of adult. In the present study, complete cDNAs for the iron-sulfur subunit (Ip) of complex II, which with Fp forms the catalytic portion of complex II, have been cloned and sequenced from anaerobic adult A. suum, and the free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. The amino acid sequences of the Ip subunits of these two nematodes are similar, particularly around the three cysteine-rich regions that are thought to comprise the iron-sulfur clusters of the enzyme. The Ip from A. suum larvae was also characterized because Northern hybridization showed that the adult Ip is also expressed in L2. The Ip of larval complex II was recognized by the antibody against adult Ip, and was indistinguishable from the adult Ip by peptide mapping. The N-terminal 42 amino acid sequence of Ip in the larval complex II purified by DEAE-cellulofine column chromatography was identical to that of the mature form of the adult Ip. Furthermore, the amino acid composition of larval Ip determined by micro-analysis on a PVDF membrane is almost the same as that of adult Ip. These results, together with the fact, that homology probing by RT-PCR, using degenerated primers, failed to find a larval-specific Ip, suggest that the two different stage-specific forms of the A. suum complex II share a common Ip subunit, even though the adult enzyme functions as a FRD, while larval enzyme acts as an SDH.
10749543	A defined medium (XF-26) containing 3 inorganic salts, 2 tricarboxylic acids, 17 amino acids, potato starch, phenol red, and agar was used as the starting point for the study. Deletions of one or more ingredients were performed to prepare various media. A medium was considered able to support growth of Xylella fastidiosa strains responsible for Pierce's disease in grapes, only after 10 serial passages had been completed. Of 3 inorganic salts, K2HPO4 and MgSO4 x 7H2O were essential, and (NH4)2HPO4 was nonessential for growth. Of the Krebs cycle intermediates, all (citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate) but isocitrate supported growth of cultivated strains, whereas only citrate alone or citrate plus succinate supported the primary isolation of PD bacterium. Of 17 amino acids, 6 uncharged polar R groups (asparagine, cysteine, glutamine, glycine, serine, and threonine) supported growth, whereas 8 nonpolar R groups (alanine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, tryptophan, and valine) or 3 positively charged polar groups (arginine, histidine, and lysine) did not. Starch proved to be nonessential.
11407111	The cAMP receptor protein (CRP; sometimes known as CAP, the catabolite gene activator protein) and the fumarate and nitrate reduction regulator (FNR) of Escherichia coli are founder members of an expanding superfamily of structurally related transcription factors. The archetypal CRP structural fold provides a very versatile mechanism for transducing environmental and metabolic signals to the transcription machinery. It allows different functional specificities at the sensory, DNA-recognition and RNA-polymerase-interaction levels to be 'mixed and matched' in order to create a diverse range of transcription factors tailored to respond to particular physiological conditions. This versatility is clearly illustrated by comparing the properties of the CRP, FNR and FLP (FNR-like protein) regulators. At the sensory level, the basic structural fold has been adapted in FNR and FLP by the acquisition in the N-terminal region of different combinations of cysteine or other residues; which bestow oxygen/redox sensing mechanisms that are poised according to the oxidative stress thresholds affecting the metabolism of specific bacteria. At the DNA-recognition level, discrimination between distinct but related DNA targets is mediated by amino acid sequence modifications in the conserved core contact between the DNA-recognition helix and target DNA. And, at the level of RNA-polymerase-interaction, different combinations of three discrete regions contacting the polymerase (the activating regions) are used for polymerase recruitment and promoting transcription.
11437361	The flavoprotein dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD) catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate. Dihydrooxonate is an analogue of dihydroorotate in which the C5 carbon is substituted by a nitrogen atom. We have investigated dihydrooxonate as a substrate of three DHODs, each representing a distinct evolutionary class of the enzyme, namely the two family 1 enzymes from Lactococcus lactis, DHODA and DHODB, and the enzyme from Escherichia coli, which, like the human enzyme, belongs to family 2. Dihydrooxonate was accepted as a substrate although much less efficiently than dihydroorotate. The first half-reaction was rate limiting according to pre-steady-state and steady-state kinetics with different electron acceptors. Cysteine and serine have been implicated as active site base residues, which promote substrate oxidation in family 1 and family 2 DHODs, respectively. Mutants of DHODA (C130A) and E. coli DHOD (S175A) have extremely low activity in standard assays with dihydroorotate as substrate, but with dihydrooxonate the mutants display considerable and increasing activity above pH 8.0. Thus, the absence of the active site base residue in the enzymes seems to be compensated for by a lower pK(a) of the 5-position in the substrate. Oxonate, the oxidation product of dihydrooxonate, was a competitive inhibitor versus dihydroorotate, and DHODA was the most sensitive of the three enzymes. DHODA was reinvestigated with respect to product inhibition by orotate. The results suggest a classical one-site ping-pong mechanism with fumarate as electron acceptor, while the kinetics with ferricyanide is highly dependent on the detailed reaction conditions.
11558281	A new thermophilic sulfate-reducing bacterium isolated from the high-temperature White Tiger oil field (Vietnam) is described. Cells of the bacterium are oval (0.4-0.6 by 0.6-1.8 microns), nonmotile, non-spore-forming, and gram-negative. Growth occurs at 45 to 65 degrees C (with an optimum at 60 degrees C) at NaCl concentrations of 0 to 50 g/l. In the course of sulfate reduction, the organism can utilize lactate, pyruvate, malate, fumarate, ethanol, salts of fatty acids (formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, caproate, palmitate), yeast extract, alanine, serine, cysteine, and H2 + CO2 (autotrophically). In addition to sulfate, the bacterium can use sulfite, thiosulfate, and elemental sulfur as electron acceptors. In the absence of electron acceptors, the bacterium can ferment pyruvate and yeast extract (a yet unrecognized capacity of sulfate reducers) with the formation of acetate and H2. The G + C content of DNA is 60.8 mol %. The level of DNA-DNA hybridization of the isolate (strain 101T) and Desulfacinum infernum (strain B alpha G1T) is as low as 34%. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of 16S rDNA places strain 101T in the phylogenetic cluster of the Desulfacinum species within the sulfate reducer subdivision of the delta subclass of Proteobacteria. All these results allowed the bacterium studied to be described as a new species, Desulfacinum subterraneum sp. nov., with strain 101 as the type strain.
13346039	1. Ovarian tissue from Bombyx mori L. larvae about to pupate was cultured in Trager's (1935) salt solution and 10 per cent hemolymph, with indifferent results. Improvement of cultures was sought by modifying the culture medium. 2. To reduce the activity of the tyrosinase, hemolymph for culture medium was heated for 5 minutes at 60 degrees C., and the coagulated protein removed. 3. A physiological solution was formulated containing cations and amino acids as they occur normally in silkworm hemolymph. In both hanging-drop and small tube cultures use of this medium brought about increased cell number, improved cell appearance, more rapid mitoses, and longer life of cultures. 4. To the solution formulated from analyses, tryptophan, cystine, cysteine, malate, fumarate, succinate, and alpha-ketoglutarate were added after testing individually, resulting in improved growth in cultures. 5. Use of a silkworm egg extract prepared 4 to 5 days after acid treatment produced an increase in cell number. 6. In small roller tube cultures, when the new medium was changed twice a week, the cells spread over the walls of the tube in 4 or 5 days (Figs. 8 and 9), rapid mitoses were observed after 2 weeks, and transparent active cells were present at 3 weeks. Subculturing was not attempted.
13367331	When solutions of streptolysin O were added to Warburg flasks containing, among other constituents, suspensions of mitochondria from the myocardium of rabbits and citrate, fumarate, or alpha-ketoglutarate as the substrate, there followed regularly a sharp reduction, and eventually complete cessation, of oxygen consumption. This phenomenon was not observed when succinate was the substrate in the flasks, the finding pointing to a selective interference with DPN as the underlying change. The agent in the solutions of streptolysin O responsible for this effect was shown to be a streptococcal product, and to be non-dialyzable and heat-labile. It differed from streptolysin O in that it did not appear to require prior activation with cysteine, and its effectiveness was not diminished by treatment with cholesterol or antistreptolysin globulins.
14203358	York, George K. (University of California, Davis), and Reese H. Vaughn. Mechanisms in the inhibition of microorganisms by sorbic acid. J. Bacteriol. 88:411-417. 1964.-Oxidative assimilation of glucose, acetate, succinate, and fumarate by washed cells of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae was inhibited by concentrations of sorbic acid ranging from 15 to 105 mg per 100 ml. At higher concentrations, the oxidation of these substrates was inhibited. Oxidative phosphorylation by submicroscopic particles of E. coli was reduced by about 30% by 37 mg per 100 ml of sorbic acid. The sulfhydryl enzymes fumarase, aspartase, and succinic dehydrogenase were inhibited by sorbic acid. The loss of activity of sorbic acid after reacting with cysteine suggested that a thiol addition occurred, which is believed to be the mechanism of action against sulfhydryl enzymes or cofactors.
14645253	The facultative anaerobe Escherichia coli adopts different metabolic modes in response to the availability of oxygen. The global transcriptional regulator FNR (fumarate-nitrate reduction) monitors the availability of oxygen in the environment. Binding as a homodimer to palindromic sequences of DNA, FNR carries a sensory domain, remote from the DNA binding helix-turn-helix motif, which responds to oxygen. The sensing mechanism involves the transformation of a [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster into a [2Fe-2S] form in vitro on reaction with oxygen. Evidence is presented to show that this process proceeds by at least two steps, the first, an oxidative one, being the formation, on reaction with O(2), of a [3Fe-4S](1+) cluster as an intermediate accompanied by the production of hydrogen peroxide. This is followed by a slower, non-redox, pseudo-first order step in which the [3Fe-4S](1+) form converts to a [2Fe-2S](2+) cluster. This must be accompanied by a substantial protein conformational change since the four cysteine ligands that bind the two forms of the FeS clusters have different spatial disposition. Hydrogen peroxide is also an oxidant of the [4Fe-4S](2+), causing a similar cluster transformation to a [2Fe-2S] form. Either the hydrogen peroxide formed on reaction with oxygen can be recycled by intracellular catalase or it can be used to oxidize further Fe-S clusters. In both cases, the efficacy of oxygen sensing by FNR will be increased.
16098206	The active form of the oxygen sensor fumarate nitrate reductase regulator (FNR) of Escherichia coli contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster which is converted to a [2Fe-2S] cluster after reaction with air, resulting in inactivation of FNR. Reaction of reconstituted [4Fe-4S].FNR with air resulted within 5 min in conversion to apoFNR. The rate was comparable to the rate known for [4Fe-4S].FNR/[2Fe-2S].FNR cluster conversion, suggesting that apoFNR is a product of [2Fe-2S].FNR decomposition and a final form of air-inactivated FNR in vitro. Formation of apoFNR and the redox state of the cysteinyl residues were determined in vitro by alkylation. FNR contains five cysteinyl residues, four of which (Cys20, Cys23, Cys29 and Cys122) ligate the FeS clusters. Alkylated FNR and proteolytic fragments thereof were analyzed by MALDI-TOF. ApoFNR formed by air inactivation of [4Fe-4S].FNR in vitro contained one or two disulfides. Only disulfide pairs Cys16/20 and Cys23/29 were formed; Cys122 was never part of a disulfide. The same type of disulfide was found in apoFNR obtained during isolation of FNR, suggesting that cysteine disulfide formation follows a fixed pattern. ApoFNR, including the form with two disulfides, can be reconstituted to [4Fe-4S].FNR after disulfide reduction. The experiments suggest that apoFNR is a major form of FNR under oxic conditions.
16223732	Continuous hydroxylation of the HIF-1 transcription factor alpha subunit by oxygen and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases promotes decay of this protein and thus prevents the transcriptional activation of many genes involved in energy metabolism, angiogenesis, cell survival, and matrix modification. Hypoxia blocks HIF-1alpha hydroxylation and thus activates HIF-1alpha-mediated gene expression. Several nonhypoxic stimuli can also activate HIF-1, although the mechanisms involved are not well known. Here we show that the glucose metabolites pyruvate and oxaloacetate inactivate HIF-1alpha decay in a manner selectively reversible by ascorbate, cysteine, histidine, and ferrous iron but not by 2-oxoglutarate or oxygen. Pyruvate and oxaloacetate bind to the 2-oxoglutarate site of HIF-1alpha prolyl hydroxylases, but their effects on HIF-1 are not mimicked by other Krebs cycle intermediates, including succinate and fumarate. We show that inactivation of HIF-1 hydroxylation by glucose-derived 2-oxoacids underlies the prominent basal HIF-1 activity commonly seen in many highly glycolytic cancer cells. Since HIF-1 itself promotes glycolytic metabolism, enhancement of HIF-1 by glucose metabolites may constitute a novel feed-forward signaling mechanism involved in malignant progression.
16739129	Brucella abortus is the etiologic agent of bovine brucellosis and causes a chronic disease in humans known as undulant fever. In livestock the disease is characterized by abortion and sterility. Live, attenuated vaccines such as S19 and RB51 have been used to control the spread of the disease in animals; however, they are considered unsafe for human use and they induce abortion in pregnant cattle. For the development of a safer and equally efficacious vaccine, immunoproteomics was utilized to identify novel candidate proteins from B. abortus cell envelope (CE). A total of 163 proteins were identified using 2-DE with MALDI-TOF MS and LC-MS/MS. Some of the major protein components include outer-membrane protein (OMP) 25, OMP31, Omp2b porin, and 60 kDa chaperonin GroEL. 2-DE Western blot analyses probed with antiserum from bovine and a human patient infected with Brucella identified several new immunogenic proteins such as fumarate reductase flavoprotein subunit, F0F1-type ATP synthase alpha subunit, and cysteine synthase A. The elucidation of the immunome of B. abortus CE identified a number of candidate proteins for developing vaccines against Brucella infection in bovine and humans.
17911304	A sulfate-reducing enrichment culture originating from coastal marine sediment of the eutrophic Tokyo Bay, Japan, was successfully established with Casamino acids as a substrate. A thiosulfate reducer, strain C/G2(T), was isolated from the enrichment culture after further enrichment with glutamate. Cells of strain C/G2(T) were non-motile rods (0.6-0.8 microm x 2.2-4.8 microm) and were found singly or in pairs and sometimes in short chains. Spores were not formed. Cells of strain C/G2(T) stained Gram-negatively, despite possessing Gram-positive cell walls. The optimum temperature for growth was 28-30 degrees C, the optimum pH was around 7.8 and the optimum salt concentration was 20-30 g l(-1). Lactate, pyruvate, serine, cysteine, threonine, glutamate, histidine, lysine, arginine, Casamino acids, peptone and yeast extract were fermented as single substrates and no sugar was used as a fermentative substrate. A Stickland reaction was observed with some pairs of amino acids. Fumarate, alanine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, glutamine and aspartate were utilized only in the presence of thiosulfate. Strain C/G2(T) fermented glutamate to H2, CO2, acetate and propionate. Thiosulfate and elemental sulfur were reduced to sulfide. Sulfate, sulfite and nitrate were not utilized as electron acceptors. The growth of strain C/G2(T) on Casamino acids or glutamate was enhanced by co-culturing with Desulfovibrio sp. isolated from the original mixed culture enriched with Casamino acids. The DNA G+C content of strain C/G2(T) was 41.0 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain C/G2(T) formed a distinct cluster with species of the genus Sedimentibacter. The closest relative was Sedimentibacter hydroxybenzoicus (with a gene sequence similarity of 91 %). On the basis of its phylogenetic and phenotypic properties, strain C/G2(T) (=JCM 13356(T)=NBRC 101112(T)=DSM 17477(T)) is proposed as representing a new genus and novel species, Dethiosulfatibacter aminovorans gen. nov., sp. nov.
18433630	The Escherichia coli fumarate and nitrate reductase (FNR) regulator protein is an important transcriptional regulator that controls the expression of a large regulon of more than 100 genes in response to changes in oxygen availability. FNR is active when it acquires a [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster under anaerobic conditions. The presence of the [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster promotes protein dimerization and site-specific DNA binding, facilitating activation or repression of target promoters. Oxygen is sensed by the controlled disassembly of the [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster, ultimately resulting in inactive, monomeric, apo-FNR. The FNR [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster is also sensitive to nitric oxide, such that under anaerobic conditions the protein is inactivated by nitrosylation of the iron-sulfur cluster, yielding a mixture of monomeric and dimeric dinitrosyl-iron cysteine species. This chapter describes some of the methods used to produce active [4Fe-4S] FNR protein and investigates the reaction of the [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster with nitric oxide and oxygen in vitro.
18448829	S-(2-succinyl)cysteine (2SC) is a chemical modification of proteins formed by a Michael addition reaction between the Krebs cycle intermediate, fumarate, and thiol groups in protein--a process known as succination of protein. Succination causes irreversible inactivation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in vitro. GAPDH was immunoprecipitated from muscle of diabetic rats, then analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy. Succination of GAPDH was increased in muscle of diabetic rats, and the extent of succination correlated strongly with the decrease in specific activity of the enzyme. We propose that 2SC is a biomarker of mitochondrial and oxidative stress in diabetes and that succination of GAPDH and other thiol proteins may provide the chemical link between glucotoxicity and the pathogenesis of diabetic complications.
19159265	"Benzylsuccinate synthase is a member of the glycyl radical family of enzymes. It catalyzes the addition of toluene to fumarate to form benzylsuccinate as the first step in the anaerobic pathway of toluene fermentation. The enzyme comprises three subunits, alpha, beta, and gamma, that in Thauera aromatica strain T1 are encoded by the tutD, tutG, and tutF genes, respectively. The large alpha-subunit contains the essential glycine and cysteine residues that are conserved in all glycyl radical enzymes. However, the function of the small beta- and gamma-subunits has remained unclear. We have overexpressed all three subunits of benzylsuccinate synthase in Escherichia coli, both individually and in combination. Coexpression of the gamma-subunit (but not the beta-subunit) is essential for efficient expression of the alpha-subunit. The benzylsuccinate synthase complex lacking the glycyl radical could be purified as an alpha(2)beta(2)gamma(2) hexamer by nickel affinity chromatography through a ""His(6)"""" affinity tag engineered onto the C-terminus of the alpha-subunit. Unexpectedly"
19384229	We review the efficacy and safety of gantacurium and AV002, two novel, investigational fumarate-based nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers, as well as sugammadex and cysteine, two novel reversal drugs that have no acetylcholinesterase inhibition properties.
20677745	Maleate isomerase (MI), a member of the Asp/Glu racemase superfamily, catalyzes cis-trans isomerization of the C2-C3 double bond in maleate to yield fumarate. Mutational studies, in conjunction with the structure of the C194A mutant of Nocardia farcinica MI cocrystallized with maleate, have revealed an unprecedented mode of catalysis for the superfamily in which the isomerization reaction is initiated by nucleophilic attack of cysteine at the double bond, yielding a covalent succinylcysteine-like intermediate.
21602364	A novel anaerobic, moderately thermophilic, NaCl-requiring fermentative bacterium, strain OS1T, was isolated from oil production water collected from Alaska, USA. Cells were Gram-negative, non-motile, non-spore-forming rods (1.7-2.7×0.4-0.5 µm). The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain OS1T was 46.6 mol%. The optimum temperature, pH and NaCl concentration for growth of strain OS1T were 55 °C, pH 7 and 10 g l(-1), respectively. The bacterium fermented D-fructose, D-glucose, maltose, D-mannose, α-ketoglutarate, L-glutamate, malonate, pyruvate, L-tartrate, L-asparagine, Casamino acids, L-cysteine, L-histidine, L-leucine, L-phenylalanine, L-serine, L-threonine, L-valine, inositol, inulin, tryptone and yeast extract. When grown on D-glucose, 3.86 mol hydrogen and 1.4 mol acetate were produced per mol substrate. Thiosulfate, sulfur and L-cystine were reduced to sulfide, and crotonate was reduced to butyrate with glucose as the electron donor. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain OS1T was related to Anaerobaculum thermoterrenum (99.7 % similarity to the type strain), a member of the phylum Synergistetes. DNA-DNA hybridization between strain OS1T and A. thermoterrenum DSM 13490T yielded 68 % relatedness. Unlike A. thermoterrenum, strain OS1T fermented malonate, maltose, tryptone, L-leucine and L-phenylalanine, but not citrate, fumarate, lactate, L-malate, glycerol, pectin or starch. The major cellular fatty acid of strain OS1T was iso-C15:0 (91 % of the total). Strain OS1T also contained iso-C13:0 3-OH (3 %), which was absent from A. thermoterrenum, and iso-C13:0 (2 %), which was absent from Anaerobaculum mobile. On the basis of these results, strain OS1T represents a novel species of the genus Anaerobaculum, for which the name Anaerobaculum hydrogeniformans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is OS1T (=DSM 22491T=ATCC BAA-1850T). An emended description of the genus Anaerobaculum is also given.
22040142	Assimilatory and dissimilatory sulphite reductions are key reactions in the biogeochemical sulphur cycle and several distinct sirohaem-containing sulphite reductases have been characterized. Here, we describe that the Epsilonproteobacterium Wolinella succinogenes is able to grow by sulphite respiration (yielding sulphide) with formate as electron donor. Sulphite is reduced by MccA, a prototypical member of an emerging new class of periplasmic cytochrome c sulphite reductases that, phylogenetically, belongs to a multihaem cytochrome c superfamily whose members play crucial roles in the global sulphur and nitrogen cycles. Within this family, MccA represents an unconventional octahaem cytochrome c containing a special haem c group that is bound via two cysteine residues arranged in a unique CX(15)CH haem c binding motif. The phenotypes of numerous W.succinogenes mutants producing MccA variants underlined the structural importance of this motif. Several open reading frames of the mcc gene cluster were individually inactivated and characterization of the corresponding mutants indicated that the predicted iron-sulphur protein MccC, the putative quinol dehydrogenase MccD (a member of the NrfD/PsrC family) as well as a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, MccB, are essential for sulphite respiration. MccA synthesis in W. succinogenes was found to be induced by sulphite (but not by thiosulphate or sulphide) and repressed in the presence of fumarate or nitrate. Based on the results, a sophisticated model of respiratory sulphite reduction by the Mcc system is presented.
22156271	Developing a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent that, like succinylcholine, has a rapid onset and a short duration of effect remains a goal of ongoing research. While rocuronium fills a portion of this need, the large doses required for rapid intubation render it a much longer-acting neuromuscular blocking agent. Postoperative residual neuromuscular block (NMB) is an increasingly recognized complication of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. This occurs because of dosing choices for neuromuscular blocking agents and anticholinesterases as well as insensitivity of typically used monitors of depth of NMB. While antagonism of NMB is necessary with partial recovery, it is unnecessary with more complete recovery. Even when monitoring with an accelerograph, reversal of NMB is complicated. In addition to the pharmacodynamics of the individual neuromuscular blocking agents, factors such as timing of anticholinesterase administration, dose of anticholinesterase, concomitant medications, electrolyte abnormalities, and hepatic or renal disease can influence the degree of reversal. Sugammadex works differently than anticholinesterases and, when administered in appropriate doses, can reverse even profound block induced with vecuronium or rocuronium. Two new fumarate neuromuscular blocking agents have a rapid onset of effect and can be reversed at any time by administration of cysteine, which could significantly reduce the risk of postoperative residual NMB.
22214383	The penultimate reaction in the oxidative degradation of nicotinate (vitamin B(3)) to fumarate in several species of aerobic bacteria is the hydrolytic deamination of maleamate to maleate, catalyzed by maleamate amidohydrolase (NicF). Although it has been considered a model system for bacterial degradation of N-heterocyclic compounds, only recently have gene clusters that encode the enzymes of this catabolic pathway been identified to allow detailed investigations concerning the structural basis of their mechanisms. Here, the Bb1774 gene from Bordetella bronchiseptica RB50, putatively annotated as nicF, has been cloned, and the recombinant enzyme, overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli, is shown to catalyze efficiently the hydrolysis of maleamate to maleate and ammonium ion. Steady-state kinetic analysis of the reaction by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) established k(cat) and K(M) values (pH 7.5 and 25 °C) of 11.7 ± 0.2 s(-1) and 128 ± 6 μM, respectively. The observed K(D) of the NicF·maleate (E·P) complex, also measured by ITC, is approximated to be 3.8 ± 0.4 mM. The crystal structure of NicF, determined at 2.4 Å using molecular replacement, shows that the enzyme belongs to the cysteine hydrolase superfamily. The structure provides insight concerning the roles of potential catalytically important residues, most notably a conserved catalytic triad (Asp29, Lys117, and Cys150) observed in the proximity of a conserved non-proline cis-peptide bond within a small cavity that is likely the active site. On the basis of this structural information, the hydrolysis of maleamate is proposed to proceed by a nucleophilic addition-elimination sequence involving the thiolate side chain of Cys150.
23625260	A novel anaerobic bacterium that could ferment amino acids and organic acids was isolated from an anaerobic, propionate-oxidizing enrichment culture originating from soil of a rice field in Japan. Cells of the isolate, designated strain 4F6E(T), were Gram-staining-negative, oxidase- and catalase-negative, non-spore-forming, vibrio-shaped, motile rods (0.8×2.0-2.5 µm) with two or three lateral flagella. Growth occurred at 20-42 °C (optimum at 37-40 °C), at pH 6.4-8.4 (optimum at pH 7.3) and at 0-1.5 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum at 0-0.5 %). Good growth occurred on glycine, serine, cysteine, pyruvate and citrate, whereas poor growth was observed on threonine, glutamine, L-malate, α-ketoglutarate, peptone and Casamino acids. In co-culture with the hydrogen-utilizing methanogen Methanobacterium formicicum JCM 10132(T), strain 4F6E(T) oxidized alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, aspartate, glutamate, histidine, asparagine and fumarate. Yeast extract was required for growth. The G+C content of genomic DNA was 61.9 mol%. A phylogenetic analysis based on comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that the type strains of Fretibacterium fastidiosum, Aminobacterium colombiense and Aminobacterium mobile, members of the family Synergistaceae, were the closest relatives of strain 4F6E(T), with low sequence similarities (89.3, 89.5 and 86.2 %, respectively). Strain 4F6E(T) contained iso-C13 : 0 (24.43 %), iso-C15 : 0 (16.47 %) and C19 : 1ω11c/C19 : 1ω9c (16.32 %) as the major fatty acids, which differed from those of F. fastidiosum, Aminobacterium colombiense and Aminobacterium mobile. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic differences between strain 4F6E(T) and the type strains of F. fastidiosum and Aminobacterium species, we propose that strain 4F6E(T) represents a novel genus and species, Aminivibrio pyruvatiphilus gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Aminivibrio pyruvatiphilus is strain 4F6E(T) ( = JCM 18417(T) = DSM 25964(T)).
23742893	The regulation of endogenous metabolites is still not fully understood in aquatic invertebrates exposed concurrently to toxicants and hypoxia. Despite the prevalence of hypoxia in the aquatic environment, toxicity estimations seldom account for multiple stressors thereby differing from natural conditions. In this study, we examined the influence of hypoxia (<30% O2) on contaminant uptake and the composition of intracellular metabolites in Lumbriculus variegatus exposed to benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P, 3μgL(-1)), chlorpyrifos (CPF, 100μgL(-1)) or pentachlorophenol (PCP, 100μgL(-1)). Tissue extracts of worms were analyzed for 123 metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and metabolite levels were then related to treatments and exposure time. Hypoxia markedly increased the accumulation of B(a)P and CPF, which underlines the significance of oxygen in chemical uptake. The oxygen effect on PCP uptake was less pronounced. Succinate and glycerol-3-phosphate increased significantly (p<0.0001) following hypoxic treatment, whereas sugars, cysteine, and cholesterol were effectively repressed. The buildup of succinate coupled with the corresponding decline in intracellular 2-oxo- and 2-hydroxy glutaric acid is indicative of an active hypoxia inducible factor mechanism. Glutamate, and TCA cycle intermediates (fumarate, and malate) were disturbed and evident in their marked suppression in worms exposed concurrently to hypoxia and PCP. Clearly, hypoxia was the dominant stressor for individuals exposed to B(a)P or CPF, but to a lesser extent upon PCP treatment. And since oxygen deprivation promotes the accumulation of different toxicants, there may be consequences on species composition of metabolites in natural conditions.
24563904	Activation of the Nrf2 stress pathway is known to play an important role in the defense mechanism against electrophilic and oxidative damage to biological macromolecules (DNA, lipids, and proteins). Chemical inducers of Nrf2 such as sulforaphane, dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera®), CDDO-Me (bardoxolone-methyl), and 3-(dimethylamino)-4-((3-isothiocyanatopropyl)(methyl)amino)cyclobut-3-ene-1,2-dione (a synthetic sulforaphane analogue; will be referred to as ) have the ability to react with Keap1 cysteine residues, leading to activation of the Antioxidant Response Element (ARE). Due to their electrophilic nature and poor matrix stability, these compounds represent great challenges when developing bioanalytical methods to evaluate in vivo exposure. like SFN reacts rapidly with glutathione (GSH) and nucleophilic groups in proteins to form covalent adducts. In this work, three procedures were developed to estimate the exposure of in a non-GLP 7 day safety study in rats: (1) protein precipitation of blood samples with methanol containing the free thiol trapping reagent 4-fluoro-7-aminosulfonylbenzofurazan (ABD-F) to measure GSH- and N-acetylcysteine conjugated metabolites of ; (2) an Edman degradation procedure to cleave and analyze N-terminal adducts of at the valine moiety; and (3) treatment with ammonium hydroxide to measure circulating free- and all sulfhydryl bound .
24676730	A mesophilic, obligately anaerobic, lactate-, alcohol-, carbohydrate- and amino-acid- degrading bacterium, designated strain 7WAY-8-7(T), was isolated from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating high-strength organic wastewater from isomerized sugar production processes. Cells of strain 7WAY-8-7(T) were motile, curved rods (0.7-1.0×5.0-8.0 µm). Spore formation was not observed. The strain grew optimally at 37 °C (range for growth was 25-40 °C) and pH 7.0 (pH 6.0-7.5), and could grow fermentatively on yeast extract, glucose, ribose, xylose, malate, tryptone, pyruvate, fumarate, Casamino acids, serine and cysteine. The main end-products of glucose fermentation were acetate and hydrogen. In co-culture with the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanospirillum hungatei DSM 864(T), strain 7WAY-8-7(T) could utilize lactate, glycerol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, L-glutamate, alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, histidine, asparagine, glutamine, arginine, lysine, threonine, 2-oxoglutarate, aspartate and methionine. A Stickland reaction was not observed with some pairs of amino acids. Yeast extract was required for growth. Nitrate, sulfate, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur, sulfite and Fe (III) were not used as terminal electron acceptors. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 61.4 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolate belongs to the uncultured environmental clone clade (called 'PD-UASB-13' in the Greengenes database) in the bacterial phylum Synergistetes, showing less than 90% sequence similarity with closely related described species such as Aminivibrio pyruvatiphilus and Aminobacterium colombiense (89.7% and 88.7%, respectively). The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C(13 : 0), iso-C(15 : 0), anteiso-C(15 : 0), C(18 : 1), C(19 : 1), C(20 : 1) and C(21 : 1). A novel genus and species, Lactivibrio alcoholicus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate strain 7WAY-8-7(T) ( = JCM 17151(T) = DSM 24196(T) = CGMCC 1.5159(T)).
24752591	Glutathione (GSH) has a crucial role in cellular signaling and antioxidant defenses either by reacting directly with reactive oxygen or nitrogen species or by acting as an essential cofactor for GSH S-transferases and glutathione peroxidases. GSH acting in concert with its dependent enzymes, known as the glutathione system, is responsible for the detoxification of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and electrophiles produced by xenobiotics. Adequate levels of GSH are essential for the optimal functioning of the immune system in general and T cell activation and differentiation in particular. GSH is a ubiquitous regulator of the cell cycle per se. GSH also has crucial functions in the brain as an antioxidant, neuromodulator, neurotransmitter, and enabler of neuron survival. Depletion of GSH leads to exacerbation of damage by oxidative and nitrosative stress; hypernitrosylation; increased levels of proinflammatory mediators and inflammatory potential; dysfunctions of intracellular signaling networks, e.g., p53, nuclear factor-κB, and Janus kinases; decreased cell proliferation and DNA synthesis; inactivation of complex I of the electron transport chain; activation of cytochrome c and the apoptotic machinery; blockade of the methionine cycle; and compromised epigenetic regulation of gene expression. As such, GSH depletion has marked consequences for the homeostatic control of the immune system, oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS) pathways, regulation of energy production, and mitochondrial survival as well. GSH depletion and concomitant increase in O&NS and mitochondrial dysfunctions play a role in the pathophysiology of diverse neuroimmune disorders, including depression, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that depleted GSH is an integral part of these diseases. Therapeutical interventions that aim to increase GSH concentrations in vivo include N-acetyl cysteine; Nrf-2 activation via hyperbaric oxygen therapy; dimethyl fumarate; phytochemicals, including curcumin, resveratrol, and cinnamon; and folate supplementation.
25019514	Oxidative stress is generated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in response to metabolic activity and environmental factors. Increased oxidative stress is associated with the pathophysiology of a broad spectrum of inflammatory diseases. Cellular response to excess ROS involves the induction of antioxidant response element (ARE) genes under control of the transcriptional activator Nrf2 and the transcriptional repressor Bach1. The development of synthetic small molecules that activate the protective anti-oxidant response network is of major therapeutic interest. Traditional small molecules targeting ARE-regulated gene activation (e.g., bardoxolone, dimethyl fumarate) function by alkylating numerous proteins including Keap1, the controlling protein of Nrf2. An alternative is to target the repressor Bach1. Bach1 has an endogenous ligand, heme, that inhibits Bach1 binding to ARE, thus allowing Nrf2-mediated gene expression including that of heme-oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), a well described target of Bach1 repression. In this report, normal human lung fibroblasts were used to screen a collection of synthetic small molecules for their ability to induce HMOX1. A class of HMOX1-inducing compounds, represented by HPP-4382, was discovered. These compounds are not reactive electrophiles, are not suppressed by N-acetyl cysteine, and do not perturb either ROS or cellular glutathione. Using RNAi, we further demonstrate that HPP-4382 induces HMOX1 in an Nrf2-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation verified that HPP-4382 treatment of NHLF cells reciprocally coordinated a decrease in binding of Bach1 and an increase of Nrf2 binding to the HMOX1 E2 enhancer. Finally we show that HPP-4382 can inhibit Bach1 activity in a reporter assay that measures transcription driven by the human HMOX1 E2 enhancer. Our results suggest that HPP-4382 is a novel activator of the antioxidant response through the modulation of Bach1 binding to the ARE binding site of target genes.
25262769	Iron-sulfur cluster proteins exhibit a range of physicochemical properties that underpin their functional diversity in biology, which includes roles in electron transfer, catalysis, and gene regulation. Transcriptional regulators that utilize iron-sulfur clusters are a growing group that exploit the redox and coordination properties of the clusters to act as sensors of environmental conditions including O2, oxidative and nitrosative stress, and metabolic nutritional status. To understand the mechanism by which a cluster detects such analytes and then generates modulation of DNA-binding affinity, we have undertaken a combined strategy of in vivo and in vitro studies of a range of regulators. In vitro studies of iron-sulfur cluster proteins are particularly challenging because of the inherent reactivity and fragility of the cluster, often necessitating strict anaerobic conditions for all manipulations. Nevertheless, and as discussed in this Account, significant progress has been made over the past decade in studies of O2-sensing by the fumarate and nitrate reduction (FNR) regulator and, more recently, nitric oxide (NO)-sensing by WhiB-like (Wbl) and FNR proteins. Escherichia coli FNR binds a [4Fe-4S] cluster under anaerobic conditions leading to a DNA-binding dimeric form. Exposure to O2 converts the cluster to a [2Fe-2S] form, leading to protein monomerization and hence loss of DNA binding ability. Spectroscopic and kinetic studies have shown that the conversion proceeds via at least two steps and involves a [3Fe-4S](1+) intermediate. The second step involves the release of two bridging sulfide ions from the cluster that, unusually, are not released into solution but rather undergo oxidation to sulfane (S(0)) subsequently forming cysteine persulfides that then coordinate the [2Fe-2S] cluster. Studies of other [4Fe-4S] cluster proteins that undergo oxidative cluster conversion indicate that persulfide formation and coordination may be more common than previously recognized. This remarkable feature suggested that the original [4Fe-4S] cluster can be restored using persulfide as the source of sulfide ion. We have demonstrated that only iron and a source of electrons are required to promote efficient conversion back from the [2Fe-2S] to the [4Fe-4S] form. We propose this as a novel in vivo repair mechanism that does not require the intervention of an iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis pathway. A number of iron-sulfur regulators have evolved to function as sensors of NO. Although it has long been known that the iron-sulfur clusters of many phylogenetically unrelated proteins are vulnerable to attack by NO, our recent studies of Wbl proteins and FNR have provided new insights into the mechanism of cluster nitrosylation, which overturn the commonly accepted view that the product is solely a mononuclear iron dinitrosyl complex (known as a DNIC). The major reaction is a rapid, multiphase process involving stepwise addition of up to eight NO molecules per [4Fe-4S] cluster. The major iron nitrosyl product is EPR silent and has optical characteristics similar to Roussin's red ester, [Fe2(NO)4(RS)2] (RRE), although a species similar to Roussin's black salt, [Fe4(NO)7(S)3](-) (RBS) cannot be ruled out. A major future challenge will be to clarify the nature of these species.
25406236	A new Gram-staining-positive, non-sporulating, mesophilic, amino acid-degrading anaerobic bacterium, designated strain OTA 102(T), was isolated from an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor treating wastewater from cooking tuna. The cells were curved rods (0.6-2.5×0.5 µm) and occurred singly or in pairs. The strain was motile by means of one lateral flagellum. Strain OTA 102(T) grew at temperatures between 30 and 45 °C (optimum 40 °C), between pH 6.0 and 8.4 (optimum pH 7.2) and NaCl concentrations between 1 and 5 % (optimum 2 %, w/v). Strain OTA 102(T) required yeast extract for growth. Serine, threonine, glycine, cysteine, citrate, fumarate, α-ketoglutarate and pyruvate were fermented. When co-cultured with Methanobacterium formicicum as the hydrogen scavenger, strain OTA 102(T) oxidized alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, aspartate, tyrosine, methionine, histidine and asparagine. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain OTA 102(T) was 41.7 mol%. The main fatty acid was iso-C15 : 0. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that strain OTA 102(T) was related to Aminobacterium colombiense and Aminobacterium mobile (95.5 and 95.2 % similarity, respectively), of the phylum Synergistetes. On the basis of phylogenetic, genetic and physiological characteristics, strain OTA 102(T) is proposed to represent a novel species of the genus Aminobacterium, Aminobacterium thunnarium sp. nov. The type strain is OTA 102(T) ( = DSM 27500(T) = JCM 19320(T)).
25984982	Mercury uptake in bacteria represents a key first step in the production and accumulation of methylmercury in biota. Previous experiments with mercury methylating bacteria have shown that Hg uptake is enhanced by some thiols, in particular cysteine, and that it is an energy-dependent process through heavy metal transporters [Schaefer et al. Environ. Sci. Technol. 2014, 48, 3007]. In this study, we examine Hg uptake in the nonmethylating facultative aerobe, Shewanella oneidensis, under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Our results demonstrate similar characteristics of the Hg uptake system to those of the Hg methylating strains: (1) uptake is enhanced in the presence of some thiols but not others; (2) uptake is energy dependent as evidenced by inhibition by a protonophore, and (3) uptake is inhibited by high Zn(II) concentrations. Initial cellular uptake rates in S. oneidensis were remarkably similar under aerobic and fumarate-reducing conditions. These data support a similar Hg(II) uptake mechanism within the proteobacteria of accidental Hg(II) transport through heavy metal transporters with similar rates of uptake but differences in the ability to take up Hg bound to different thiols.
25985877	We have studied the viability of targeted molecular screening for the identification of female patients with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) syndrome. Affected patients harbor a germ-line heterozygous mutation of the fumarate hydratase (FH) gene. Clinically, some patients present with aggressive renal cell carcinoma. Concerning women, in almost all cases, this is preceded by symptomatic uterine leiomyoma. We aimed to identify women operated on for symptomatic leiomyoma by the age of 30. Archived paraffin-embedded leiomyoma tissue was tested for the FH gene mutation in 14 cases. Two patients with multiple leiomyomas and with the confirmed germ-line mutations c.1433_1434dupAAA, p.(Lys477dup) and c.953A>T, p.(His318Leu) were identified and enrolled in a surveillance program. Statistically significant correlation between the presence of multiple uterine leiomyomas (more than seven in our experience) and the FH gene mutation was found. The immunohistochemical expression pattern, of simultaneous FH absence and S-(2-succino)cysteine (2SC) positivity, correlated with the results of the molecular genetic study in only one case. The histomorphologically simultaneous detection of enlarged nucleoli with a clear halo of leiomyocyte nuclei, their fibrillary cytoplasm, the presence of eosinophilic globules, and staghorn vessels proved to be only a partially sensitive indicator of HLRCC-associated leiomyoma and fully correlated with immunohistochemistry and molecular genetic study only in one case. Molecular genetic testing is presently the only reliable diagnostic tool able to identify HLRCC patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the presence of multiple leiomyomas in women with the FH gene mutation who are younger than 30 years old should be confirmed in larger scale studies. The applied targeted molecular screening protocol proved to be effective, resulting in identification of two positive patients out of fourteen tested individuals.
26961188	The intracellular proteomes of the Penicillium chrysogenum throughout pilot and industrial processes were investigated by using 2-DE combined with MALDI-TOF-TOF MS, respectively. We detected a total of 223 spots corresponding to 154 proteins and 231 spots corresponding to 157 proteins throughout pilot and industrial processes, respectively. The levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase increased (5.1- and 2.5-fold) under the pilot process, while its levels were no significant changes under the industrial process at 140 and 170 h when compared with that at 2 h. The levels of isocitrate lyase and fumarate hydratase were increased significantly under the industrial process, while their levels had no obvious changes after 20 h of fermentation throughout the pilot process. These results indicate that there were remarkable differences in carbohydrate metabolism (including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, and tricarboxylic acid cycle) of P. chrysogenum during the pilot and industrial fermentations, which likely result in alterations of the primary metabolism and penicillin biosynthesis. Moreover, the differences in the levels of proteins involved in amino acid metabolisms (including valine, cysteine, and α-aminoadipic acid biosynthesis) indicated that the pilot and industrial processes influenced the supplies of penicillin precursors. Compared with that at 2 h, the maximum levels of superoxide (6.9-fold, at 32 h) and catalase (9-fold, at 80 h) during the industrial process and the maximum levels of superoxide (1.2-fold, at 20 h) and catalase (7.7-fold at 128 h) during the pilot process revealed the significant difference in cell redox homeostasis and stress responses during scale-up fermentation. Particularly, 10 spots corresponding to isopenicillin N synthetase and 4 spots corresponding to isopenicillin N (IPN) acyltransferase in pilot and industrial processes were identified, respectively. The levels of IPN acyltransferase (spots 197 and 198) and CoA ligase at 80 h during the industrial process were around 2-fold of that during the pilot process, indicating that the industrial process with a higher penicillin production per cell might provide available environments to induce over-expression of IPN acyltransferase and accelerate penicillin formation. These results provide new insights into the globally potential responses of P. chrysogenum to variations of environments in different fermentation scales so as to consequently regulate the penicillin production.
27718209	Recent findings in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) suggest that altering certain bacterial populations present in the gut may lead to a proinflammatory condition, that could result in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS). Also, Reactive Oxygen Species seem to be involved in the course of MS. In this study, it has been aimed to relate all these variables starting from an analysis of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding protein (LBP) with the determination of parameters related to oxidative stress in the blood, brain and spinal cord. For this purpose, samples obtained from EAE rats and relapsing-remitting (RRMS) MS patients were used. In addition, EAE rats were treated with Natalizumab, N-acetyl-cysteine and dimethyl fumarate. Natalizumab was also employed in RRMS. The results of this study revealed an improvement in the clinical symptoms of the EAE and MS with the treatments, as well as a reduction in the oxidative stress parameters and in LBP. Correlations between the clinical variables of the disease, i.e. oxidative damage and LBP, were established. Although the conclusions of this research are indeed relevant, further investigation would be necessary to establish the intrinsic mechanisms of the MS-oxidative stress-microbiota relationship.
27991798	Hibernation is an evolutionary adaptation that affords some mammals the ability to exploit the cold to achieve extreme metabolic depression (torpor) while avoiding ischemia/reperfusion or hemorrhagic shock injuries. Hibernators cycle periodically out of torpor, restoring high metabolic activity. If understood at the molecular level, the adaptations underlying torpor-arousal cycles may be leveraged for translational applications in critical fields such as intensive care medicine. Here, we monitored 266 metabolites to investigate the metabolic adaptations to hibernation in plasma from 13-lined ground squirrels (57 animals, 9 time points). Results indicate that the periodic arousals foster the removal of potentially toxic oxidative stress-related metabolites, which accumulate in plasma during torpor while replenishing reservoirs of circulating catabolic substrates (free fatty acids and amino acids). Specifically, we identified metabolic fluctuations of basic amino acids lysine and arginine, one-carbon metabolism intermediates, and sulfur-containing metabolites methionine, cysteine, and cystathionine. Conversely, reperfusion injury markers such as succinate/fumarate remained relatively stable across cycles. Considering the cycles of these metabolites with the hibernator's cycling metabolic activity together with their well-established role as substrates for the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), we hypothesize that these metabolic fluctuations function as a biological clock regulating torpor to arousal transitions and resistance to reperfusion during arousal.
28219662	Enzymes of central carbon metabolism are essential mediators of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) physiology and pathogenicity, but are often perceived to lack sufficient species selectivity to be pursued as potential drug targets. Fumarase (Fum) is an enzyme of the canonical tricarboxylic acid cycle and is dispensable in many organisms. Transposon mutagenesis studies in Mtb, however, indicate that Fum is required for optimal growth. Here, we report the generation and characterization of a genetically engineered Mtb strain in which Fum expression is conditionally regulated. This revealed that Fum deficiency is bactericidal in vitro and during both the acute and chronic phases of mouse infection. This essentiality is linked to marked accumulations of fumarate resulting in protein and metabolite succination, a covalent modification of cysteine thiol residues. These results identify Mtb Fum as a potentially species-specific drug target whose inactivation may kill Mtb through a covalently irreversible form of metabolic toxicity.
28229591	Like many cancer types, colorectal cancers have dysregulated metabolism that promotes their pathogenic features. In this study, we used the activity-based protein profiling chemoproteomic platform to profile cysteine-reactive metabolic enzymes that are upregulated in primary human colorectal tumors. We identified argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) as an upregulated target in primary human colorectal tumors and show that pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of ASS1 impairs colorectal cancer pathogenicity. Using metabolomic profiling, we show that ASS1 inhibition leads to reductions in the levels of oncogenic metabolite fumarate, leading to impairments in glycolytic metabolism that supports colorectal cancer cell pathogenicity. We show here that ASS1 inhibitors may represent a novel therapeutic approach for attenuating colorectal cancer through compromising critical metabolic and metabolite signaling pathways and demonstrate the utility of coupling chemoproteomic and metabolomic strategies to map novel metabolic regulators of cancer.
28664937	Leiomyomas associated with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome and leiomyomas with bizarre nuclei often show overlapping morphological features, in particular cells with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli, perinucleolar halos, and eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions. Although hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome is defined by fumarate hydratase (FH) germline mutations, resulting in S-(2-succino)-cysteine (2SC) formation, it is unknown whether leiomyomas with bizarre nuclei show similar alterations. In this study, we evaluated the morphology and FH/2SC immunoprofile of 31 leiomyomas with bizarre nuclei. DNA from tumor and normal tissues from 24 cases was subjected to massively parallel sequencing targeting 410 key cancer genes. Somatic genetic alterations were detected using state-of-the-art bioinformatics algorithms. No patient reported a personal history of renal neoplasia or cutaneous leiomyomas, but one had a family history of renal cell carcinoma while another had a family history of uterine leiomyomas. Aberrant FH/2SC expression was noted in 17 tumors (16 FH-negative/2SC-positive, 1 FH-positive/2SC-positive). On univariate analysis, staghorn vessels, eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions, diffuse distribution of prominent eosinophilic nucleoli with perinucleolar halos, and an 'alveolar pattern of edema' were associated with an abnormal immunoprofile, but only staghorn vessels remained significant on multivariate analysis. Massively parallel sequencing analysis (n=24) revealed that 13/14 tumors with aberrant FH/2SC immunoprofile harbored somatic FH somatic genetic alterations, including homozygous deletions (n=9), missense mutations coupled with loss of heterozygosity (n=3), and a splice site mutation (n=1), whereas no somatic FH mutations/deletions were found in tumors with normal immunoprofile (n=10; P<0.0001). Leiomyomas with bizarre nuclei with normal FH/2SC staining pattern more frequently harbored TP53 and/or RB1 alterations than those with aberrant FH/2SC immunoprofile (60 vs 14%; P=0.032). These data demonstrate that leiomyomas with bizarre nuclei are morphologically and genetically heterogeneous and that hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome-related morphological features, abnormal FH/2SC staining, and somatic FH mutations/deletions can be seen in a subset of sporadic tumors.
29068222	Perdeuteration with selective 1H,13C-enrichment of methyl groups has enabled solution NMR studies of large (30 kDa) protein systems. However, we propose that for all non-methyl positions, only magnetization originating from 1H-12C groups is sufficiently long-lived, and it can be transferred via through-space NOEs to slowly relaxing 1H-15N or 1H-13C methyl groups to achieve multidimensional solution NMR. We demonstrate stereoselective 1H,12C-labeling by adding relatively inexpensive unlabeled carbon sources to Escherichia coli growth media in D2O. Using our model system, a mutant WW domain from human Pin1, we compare deuteration patterns in 19 amino acids (all except cysteine). Protein grown using glucose as the sole carbon source had high levels of protonation in aromatic rings and the H positions of serine and tryptophan. In contrast, using our FROMP media (fumarate, rhamnose, oxalate, malonate, pyruvate), stereoselective protonation of H2 with deuteration at H and H3 was achieved in Asp, Asn, Lys, and Met residues. In solution NMR, stereospecific chemical shift assignments for H are typically obtained in conjunction with 1 dihedral angle determinations using 3-bond J-coupling (3JN-H, 3JCO-H, 3JH-H) experiments. However, due to motional averaging, the assumption of a pure rotameric state can yield incorrect 1 dihedral angles with incorrect stereospecific assignments. This was the case for three residues in the Pin1 WW domain (Lys28, Met30, and Asn44). Thus, stereoselective 1H,12C-labeling will be useful not only for NMR studies of large protein systems, but also for determining side chain rotamers and dynamics in any protein system.
29414784	For nearly 30 years, coenzyme M (CoM) was assumed to be present solely in methanogenic archaea. In the late 1990s, CoM was reported to play a role in bacterial propene metabolism, but no biosynthetic pathway for CoM has yet been identified in bacteria. Here, using bioinformatics and proteomic approaches in the metabolically versatile bacterium Xanthobacter autotrophicus Py2, we identified four putative CoM biosynthetic enzymes encoded by the xcbB1, C1, D1, and E1 genes. Only XcbB1 was homologous to a known CoM biosynthetic enzyme (ComA), indicating that CoM biosynthesis in bacteria involves enzymes different from those in archaea. We verified that the ComA homolog produces phosphosulfolactate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), demonstrating that bacterial CoM biosynthesis is initiated similarly as the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent methanogenic archaeal pathway. The bioinformatics analysis revealed that XcbC1 and D1 are members of the aspartase/fumarase superfamily (AFS) and that XcbE1 is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-containing enzyme with homology to d-cysteine desulfhydrases. Known AFS members catalyze -elimination reactions of succinyl-containing substrates, yielding fumarate as the common unsaturated elimination product. Unexpectedly, we found that XcbC1 catalyzes -elimination on phosphosulfolactate, yielding inorganic phosphate and a novel metabolite, sulfoacrylic acid. Phosphate-releasing -elimination reactions are unprecedented among the AFS, indicating that XcbC1 is an unusual phosphatase. Direct demonstration of phosphosulfolactate synthase activity for XcbB1 and phosphate -elimination activity for XcbC1 strengthened their hypothetical assignment to a CoM biosynthetic pathway and suggested functions also for XcbD1 and E1. Our results represent a critical first step toward elucidating the CoM pathway in bacteria.
30168206	"The transcriptional activator CooA belongs to the CRP/FNR (cAMP receptor protein/fumarate and nitrate reductase) superfamily of transcriptional regulators and uses heme to sense carbon monoxide (CO). Effector-driven allosteric activation is well understood in CRP, a CooA homologue. A structural allosteric activation model for CooA exists which parallels that of CRP; however, the role of protein dynamics, which is crucial in CRP, is not well understood in CooA. We employed site-directed spin labeling electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to probe CooA motions on the s-ms timescale. We created a series of Cys substitution variants, each with a cysteine residue introduced into a key functional region of the protein: K26C, E60C, F132C, D134C, and S175C. The heme environment and DNA binding affinity of each variant were comparable to those of wild-type CooA, with the exception of F132C, which displayed reduced DNA binding affinity. This observation confirms a previously hypothesized role for Phe132 in transmitting the allosteric CO binding signal. Osmolyte perturbation studies of Fe(III) ""locked-off"""" CooA variants labeled with either MTSL or MAL-6 nitroxide spin labels revealed that multicomponent EPR spectra report on conformational flexibility on the s-ms timescale. Multiple dynamic populations exist at every site examined in the structurally uncharacterized Fe(III) """"locked-off"""" CooA. This observation suggests that"
30341347	Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) has been applied for decades in the treatment of psoriasis and now also multiple sclerosis. However, the mechanism of action has remained obscure and involves high dose over long time of this small, reactive compound implicating many potential targets. Based on a 1.9 Å resolution crystal structure of the C-terminal kinase domain of the mouse p90 Ribosomal S6 Kinase 2 (RSK2) inhibited by DMF we describe a central binding site in RSKs and the closely related Mitogen and Stress-activated Kinases (MSKs). DMF reacts covalently as a Michael acceptor to a conserved cysteine residue in the αF-helix of RSK/MSKs. Binding of DMF prevents the activation loop of the kinase from engaging substrate, and stabilizes an auto-inhibitory αL-helix, thus pointing to an effective, allosteric mechanism of kinase inhibition. The biochemical and cell biological characteristics of DMF inhibition of RSK/MSKs are consistent with the clinical protocols of DMF treatment.
30633362	Metabolism directs the severe acute inflammatory reaction of monocytes to guard homeostasis. This occurs by sequentially activating anabolic immune effector mechanisms, switching to immune deactivation mechanisms and then restoring immunometabolic homeostasis. Nuclear sirtuin 1 and mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase metabolically drive this dynamic and are druggable targets that promote immunometabolic resolution in septic mice and increase survival. We used unbiased metabolomics and a validated monocyte culture model of activation, deactivation, and partial resolution of acute inflammation to sequentially track metabolic rewiring. Increases in glycogenolysis, hexosamine, glycolysis, and pentose phosphate pathways were aligned with anabolic activation. Activation transitioned to combined lipid, protein, amino acid, and nucleotide catabolism during deactivation, and partially subsided during early resolution. Lipid metabolic rewiring signatures aligned with deactivation included elevated n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and increased levels of fatty acid acylcarnitines. Increased methionine to homocysteine cycling increased levels of s-adenosylmethionine rate-limiting transmethylation mediator, and homocysteine and cysteine transsulfuration preceded increases in glutathione. Increased tryptophan catabolism led to elevated kynurenine and de novo biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide from quinolinic acid. Increased branched-chain amino acid catabolism paralleled increases in succinyl-CoA. A rise in the Krebs cycle cis-aconitate-derived itaconate and succinate with decreased fumarate and acetyl-CoA levels occurred concomitant with deactivation and subsided during early resolution. The data suggest that rewiring of metabolic and mitochondrial bioenergetics by monocytes sequentially activates, deactivates, and resolves acute inflammation.
30756407	Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a fumaric acid ester registered for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). It induces protein succination leading to inactivation of cysteine-rich proteins. It was first shown to possess cytoprotective and antioxidant effects in noncancer models, which appeared related to the induction of the nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway. DMF also displays antitumor activity in several cellular and mice models. Recently, we showed that the anticancer mechanism of DMF is dose-dependent and is paradoxically related to the decrease in the nuclear translocation of NRF2. Some other studies performed indicate also the potential role of DMF in cancers, which are dependent on the NRF2 antioxidant and cellular detoxification program, such as KRAS-mutated lung adenocarcinoma. It, however, seems that DMF has multiple biological effects as it has been shown to also inhibit the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), thus blocking downstream targets that may be involved in the development and progression of inflammatory cascades leading to various disease processes, including tumors, lymphomas, diabetic retinopathy, arthritis, and psoriasis. Herein, we present the current status and future directions of the use of DMF in various diseases models with particular emphases on its targeting of specific intracellular signal transduction cascades in cancer; to shed some light on its possible mode of action.
31279969	Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is widely used to treat the human autoimmune diseases multiple sclerosis (MS) and psoriasis. DMF causes short-term oxidative stress and activates the antioxidant response via the transcription factor Nrf2 but its immunosuppressive effect is not well understood. Immune cell activation depends on calcium signaling which itself is influenced by the cellular redox state. We therefore measured calcium, reactive oxygen species levels and glutathione content in lymphocytes from immunized mice before onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from MS patients treated with DMF, and in mouse splenocytes treated ex vivo with DMF. This demonstrated altered redox states and increased lymphocytic calcium levels in all model systems. DMF caused an immediate influx of calcium from the extracellular space, long-term increased cytosolic calcium levels and reduced calcium stored in intracellular stores. The DMF-elicited current had the electrophysiological characteristics of a transient receptor potential channel and the intracellular calcium levels were normalized by antagonists of TRPA1. Interestingly, the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase SERCA2b was downregulated but more active due to glutathionylation of the redox-sensitive cysteine 674. DMF therefore causes pleiotropic changes in cellular calcium homeostasis which are likely caused by redox-sensitive post-translational modifications. These changes probably contribute to its immunosuppressive effects.
31477291	Maternal supply of methyl donors such as methionine (Met) during late pregnancy can affect offspring growth and development. The objective was to investigate the effect of postruminal Met supply during late pregnancy on 1-carbon, Met cycle, and transsulfuration pathways in the calf liver. During the last 28 d of pregnancy, cows were individually fed a control diet or the control diet plus rumen-protected dl-Met (MET; 0.09% dry matter intake). Liver samples obtained from calves (n = 14/group) at 4, 14, 28, and 50 d of age were used for metabolomics, real-time PCR, and enzyme activity analyses. Genes associated with 1-carbon metabolism, DNA methylation, and the cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine-choline pathway were analyzed via real-time PCR. Activity of betaine homocysteine methyltransferase, cystathionine -synthase, and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR) was analyzed using 14C isotopes. Data were analyzed using a mixed model that included the fixed effects of maternal treatment, day, and their interaction, and the random effect was calf within maternal diet. Calves born to dams offered MET tended to have greater birth body weight and had overall greater body weight during the first 9 wk of life. However, no differences were detected for daily feed intake and average daily gain between groups. Concentrations of betaine and choline, reflecting Met cycle activity, at d 14 through 28 were greater in MET calves. Transsulfuration pathway intermediates also were altered in MET calves, with concentrations of cysteine sulfinic acid and hypotaurine (d 4 and 14) and taurine being greater (d 4, 14, 28, and 50). Despite the lack of differences in daily feed intake, the greater concentrations of the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates fumarate and glutamate along with NAD/NADH in MET calves indicated enhanced rates of energy metabolism. Although activity of betaine homocysteine methyltransferase was greater in MET calves at d 14, cystathionine -synthase was lower and increased at d 14 and 28, where it was greater compared with the control diet. Activity of MTR was lower at d 4 and 50 in MET calves. Among gene targets measured, MET calves had greater overall expression of MTR, phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, and choline kinase  and . An interaction of maternal diet by time was detected for mRNA abundance of DNA methyltransferase 3 (involved in de novo methylation) due to greater values at d 4 and 14 in MET calves. Overall, the data indicate that enhanced postruminal supply of Met to cows during late pregnancy may program hepatic metabolism of the calf in the context of maintaining Met homeostasis, phosphatidylcholine and taurine synthesis, DNA methylation, and energy metabolism. These alterations potentially result in better efficiency of nutrient use, hence conferring the calf a physiologic advantage during a period of rapid growth and development. The precise biologic mechanisms remain to be established.
32053878	The skin represents an indispensable barrier between the organism and the environment and is the first line of defense against exogenous insults. The transcription factor NRF2 is a central regulator of cytoprotection and stress resistance. NRF2 is activated in response to oxidative stress by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and electrophiles. These electrophiles oxidize specific cysteine residues of the NRF2 inhibitor KEAP1, leading to KEAP1 inactivation and, subsequently, NRF2 activation. As oxidative stress is associated with inflammation, the NRF2 pathway plays important roles in the pathogenesis of common inflammatory diseases and cancer in many tissues and organs, including the skin. The electrophile and NRF2 activator dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an established and efficient drug for patients suffering from the common inflammatory skin disease psoriasis and the neuro-inflammatory disease multiple sclerosis (MS). In this review, we discuss possible molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic activity of DMF and other NRF2 activators. Recent evidence suggests that electrophiles not only activate NRF2, but also target other inflammation-associated pathways including the transcription factor NF-κB and the multi-protein complexes termed inflammasomes. Inflammasomes are central regulators of inflammation and are involved in many inflammatory conditions. Most importantly, the NRF2 and inflammasome pathways are connected at different levels, mainly antagonistically.
32250583	"Metabolites regulate protein function via covalent and noncovalent interactions. However, manipulating these interactions in living cells remains a major challenge. Here, we report a chemical strategy for inducing cysteine S-succination, a nonenzymatic post-translational modification derived from the oncometabolite fumarate. Using a combination of antibody-based detection and kinetic assays, we benchmark the in vitro and cellular reactivity of two novel S-succination ""agonists"
32262734	This report describes the synthesis, structure, and O2-binding properties of core-shell clusters composed of human haemoglobin A (HbA) in the centre and human serum albumin (HSA) at the periphery (HbA-HSAm) as potential O2-carriers designed as red blood cell (RBC) substitutes. Protein clusters were prepared by covalent linkages between HbA lysins and HSA cysteine-34 using a heterobifunctional cross-linker, succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate. Major products (m = 2, 3, 4) were isolated using gel filtration chromatography. The low isoelectric points (pI = 5.0-5.2) of the clusters were almost identical to that of HSA, proving the wrapping of HbA by negatively charged HSA. The 3D reconstruction of HbA-HSA3 based on transmission electron microscopy images revealed a complete triangular structure. The proposed geometries enabled us to assign a possible spatial arrangement of the HbA centre and HSA periphery. The HbA-HSAm clusters showed higher O2-affinities (P50 = 8-9 Torr) than the native HbA. The clusters prepared under N2 atmosphere showed a low O2-affinity (P50 = 26 Torr) resembling those of human RBC. Moreover, the cluster containing an -cross-linked HbA with bis(3,5-dibromosalicyl)fumarate showed a markedly low O2-affinity (P50 = 35 Torr). These HbA-HSAm clusters with various O2-affinities can support a new generation of RBC substitutes, which can be better tuned to play a role in O2 transport.
32309199	Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) has an inhibitory effect on the production of pro-inflammatory proteins from different cells which participate in the immune reaction in psoriatic skin. Most recently it was shown that DMF is an allosteric covalent inhibitor of the p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (RSK1, 2), determined by X-ray crystallography. DMF binds to a specific cysteine residue in RSK2 and in the closely related mitogen and stress-activated kinases 1 (MSK1) which inhibits further downstream activation.
32344663	Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation play critical roles in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). A previous study has demonstrated that dimethyl fumarate (DMF) protects mice from dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis via its potential antioxidant capacity, and by inhibiting the activation of the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. This study aims to clarify the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant responsive element (Nrf2/ARE) pathway pharmacological activation and anti-inflammatory effect by DMF, through focusing on other crucial antioxidant enzymes and inflammatory mediator, including glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), in a DSS-induced colitis mouse model. The oral administration of DMF attenuated the shortening of colons and alleviated colonic inflammation. Furthermore, the expression of key antioxidant enzymes, including GCLC and GPX, in the colonic tissue were significantly increased by DMF administration. In addition, protein expression of the inflammatory mediator, COX-2, was reduced by DMF administration. Our results suggest that DMF alleviates DSS-induced colonic inflammatory damage, likely via up-regulating GCLC and GPX and down-regulating COX-2 protein expression in colonic tissue.
33828088	Ferroptosis is a novel type of programmed cell death, which is different from apoptosis and autophagic cell death. Recently, ferroptosis has been indicated to contribute to the in vitro neurotoxicity induced by isoflurane, which is one of the most common anesthetics in clinic. However, the in vivo position of ferroptosis in isoflurane-induced neurotoxicity as well as learning and memory impairment remains unclear. In this study, we mainly explored the relationship between ferroptosis and isoflurane-induced learning and memory, as well as the therapeutic methods in mouse model. Our results indicated that isoflurane induced the ferroptosis in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner in hippocampus, the organ related with learning and memory ability. In addition, the activity of cytochrome c oxidase/Complex IV in mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) was increased by isoflurane, which might further contributed to cysteine deprivation-induced ferroptosis caused by isoflurane exposure. More importantly, isoflurane-induced ferroptosis could be rescued by both ferroptosis inhibitor (ferrostatin-1) and mitochondria activator (dimethyl fumarate), which also showed effective therapeutic action against isoflurane-induced learning and memory impairment. Taken together, our data indicate the close association among ferroptosis, mitochondria and isoflurane, and provide a novel insight into the therapy mode against isoflurane-induced learning and memory impairment.
33914705	Hypoxia is a hallmark of solid tumors that promotes cell growth, survival, and metastasis and confers resistance to chemo and radiotherapies. Hypoxic responses are largely mediated by the transcription factors hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and HIF-2α. Our work demonstrates that HIF-2α is essential for colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. However, targeting hypoxic cells is difficult, and tumors rapidly acquire resistance to inhibitors of HIF-2α. To overcome this limitation, we performed a small molecule screen to identify HIF-2α-dependent vulnerabilities. Several known ferroptosis activators and dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a cell-permeable mitochondrial metabolite derivative, led to selective synthetic lethality in HIF-2α-expressing tumor enteroids. Our work demonstrated that HIF-2α integrated 2 independent forms of cell death via regulation of cellular iron and oxidation. First, activation of HIF-2α upregulated lipid and iron regulatory genes in CRC cells and colon tumors in mice and led to a ferroptosis-susceptible cell state. Second, via an iron-dependent, lipid peroxidation-independent pathway, HIF-2α activation potentiated ROS via irreversible cysteine oxidation and enhanced cell death. Inhibition or knockdown of HIF-2α decreased ROS and resistance to oxidative cell death in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrated a mechanistic vulnerability in cancer cells that were dependent on HIF-2α that can be leveraged for CRC treatment.
33931688	Pathogenic mutations in fumarate hydratase (FH) drive hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) and increase the risk of developing uterine leiomyomas (ULMs). An integrated proteogenomic analysis of ULMs from HLRCC (n = 16; FH-mutation confirmed) and non-syndromic (NS) patients (n = 12) identified a significantly higher protein:transcript correlation in HLRCC (R = 0.35) vs. NS ULMs (R = 0.242, MWU p = 0.0015). Co-altered proteins and transcripts (228) included antioxidant response element (ARE) target genes, such as thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), and correlated with activation of NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response signaling in HLRCC ULMs. We confirm 185 transcripts previously described as altered between HLRCC and NS ULMs, 51 co-altered at the protein level and several elevated in HLRCC ULMs are involved in regulating cellular metabolism and glycolysis signaling. Furthermore, 367 S-(2-succino)cysteine peptides were identified in HLRCC ULMs, of which sixty were significantly elevated in HLRCC vs. NS ULMs (LogFC = 1.86, MWU p < 0.0001). These results confirm and define novel proteogenomic alterations in uterine leiomyoma tissues collected from HLRCC patients and underscore conserved molecular alterations correlating with inactivation of the FH tumor suppressor gene.
34180725	Fumarate hydratase (FH)-deficient renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a rare and clinically aggressive RCC subtype that is commonly associated with the hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome. The diagnostic hallmark of FH-deficient RCC is a high-grade microscopic appearance with prominent inclusion-like eosinophilic nucleoli and perinucleolar halos. Herein we report a case of an FH-deficient RCC in a 30-year-old female that exhibited low-grade nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, reminiscent of the clinically more indolent succinate dehydrogenase-deficient RCC subtype and the newly described eintity, eosinophilic, solid and cystic RCC. This case illustrates that FH-deficient RCC can have a wide spectrum of microscopic appearances, including low-grade eosinophilic RCC. In addition, it highlights that a low threshold to perform the immunohistochemical stains for FH and S-(2-succino) cysteine is warranted in RCC cases with unusual and even low-grade eosinophilic morphology.
34340539	The Helicobacter pylori chemoreceptor TlpA plays a role in dampening host inflammation during chronic stomach colonization. TlpA has a periplasmic dCache_1 domain, a structure that is capable of sensing many ligands; however, the only characterized TlpA signals are arginine, bicarbonate, and acid. To increase our understanding of TlpA's sensing profile, we screened for diverse TlpA ligands using ligand binding arrays. TlpA bound seven ligands with affinities in the low- to middle-micromolar ranges. Three of these ligands, arginine, fumarate, and cysteine, were TlpA-dependent chemoattractants, while the others elicited no response. Molecular docking experiments, site-directed point mutants, and competition surface plasmon resonance binding assays suggested that TlpA binds ligands via both the membrane-distal and -proximal dCache_1 binding pockets. Surprisingly, one of the nonactive ligands, glucosamine, acted as a chemotaxis antagonist, preventing the chemotaxis response to chemoattractant ligands, and acted to block the binding of ligands irrespective of whether they bound the membrane-distal or -proximal dCache_1 subdomains. In total, these results suggest that TlpA senses multiple attractant ligands as well as antagonist ones, an emerging theme in chemotaxis systems. IMPORTANCE Numerous chemotactic bacterial pathogens depend on the ability to sense a diverse array of signals through chemoreceptors to achieve successful colonization and virulence within their host. The signals sensed by chemoreceptors, however, are not always fully understood. This is the case for TlpA, a dCache_1 chemoreceptor of H. pylori that enables the bacterium to induce less inflammation during chronic infections. H. pylori causes a significant global disease burden, which is driven by the development of gastric inflammation. Accordingly, it is essential to understand the processes by which H. pylori modulates host inflammation. This work uncovers the signals that TlpA can sense and highlights the underappreciated ability to regulate chemotactic responses by antagonistic chemoreceptor ligands, which is an emerging theme among other chemotactic systems.
34561376	Fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma (FH-deficient RCC) is typically considered a high-grade, aggressive subtype of RCC that frequently arises in the setting of hereditary leiomyomatosis-renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) syndrome. Increasing experience with HLRCC-associated RCC and FH-deficient RCC has resulted in recognition of tumors with lower grade morphologic features, overlapping with those of succinate dehydrogenase-deficient RCC and other low-grade oncocytic tumors. In this review article, we report a previously unpublished case that was recently encountered in our practice and review cases in the current literature with an aim of getting a better understanding of these oncocytic tumors and their morphologic spectrum. The 13 cases reviewed were approximately equally distributed across males and females, occurred at a younger age, and were more frequently seen in the right kidney, with both unifocal and multifocal presentations. While most presented an exclusive, low-grade oncocytic morphology, in 4 cases they were associated with either separate high-grade tumors, or as a secondary pattern in an otherwise conventional high-grade FH-deficient RCC. Loss of FH and 2 succinyl cysteine (2SC) positivity by immunohistochemistry supported their diagnosis, and are recommended to be performed alongside CD117, CK7, and CK20 in to aid classification in challenging oncocytic tumors. When occurring in isolation, these tumors are distinctive from their high-grade counterparts, with no reported adverse outcomes in cases reported thus far. As such, accurate diagnosis of this low-grade pattern among FH-deficient RCCs is worthwhile not only due to its association with HLRCC and need of genetic counseling and surveillance, but also due to more favorable prognosis. Finally, increasing experience with the low-grade end of the morphologic spectrum of FH deficient RCC reiterates that not all tumors of this subtype of RCC have a uniformly aggressive outcome.
34678832	Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) is a tumor predisposition syndrome caused by germline fumarate hydratase (FH) mutations and characterized by uterine and cutaneous leiomyomas and renal cell cancer. Currently, there is no generally approved method to differentiate FH-deficient uterine leiomyomas from other leiomyomas. Here, we analyzed 3 antibodies (S-(2-succino)-cysteine [2SC], aldo-keto reductase family 1, member B10 [AKR1B10], and FH) as potential biomarkers. The study consisted of 2 sample series. The first series included 155 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded uterine leiomyomas, of which 90 were from HLRCC patients and 65 were sporadic. The second series included 1590 unselected fresh frozen leiomyomas. Twenty-seven tumors were from known HLRCC patients, while the FH status for the remaining 1563 tumors has been determined by copy number analysis and Sanger sequencing revealing 45 tumors with monoallelic (n=33) or biallelic (n=12) FH loss. Altogether 197 samples were included in immunohistochemical analyses: all 155 samples from series 1 and 42 available corresponding formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from series 2 (15 tumors with monoallelic and 7 with biallelic FH loss, 20 with no FH deletion). Results show that 2SC performed best with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Scoring was straightforward with unambiguously positive or negative results. AKR1B10 identified most tumors accurately with 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity. FH was 100% specific but showed slightly reduced 91% sensitivity. Both FH and AKR1B10 displayed also intermediate staining intensities. We suggest that when patient's medical history and/or histopathologic tumor characteristics indicate potential FH-deficiency, the tumor's FH status is determined by 2SC staining. When aberrant staining is observed, the patient can be directed to genetic counseling and mutation screening.
35347586	The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is composed of the endocannabinoid ligands anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylgycerol (2-AG), their target cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) and the enzymes involved in their synthesis and metabolism (N-acyltransferase and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in the case of AEA and diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) in the case of 2-AG). The origins of ECS dysfunction in major neuropsychiatric disorders remain to be determined, and this paper explores the possibility that they may be associated with chronically increased nitro-oxidative stress and activated immune-inflammatory pathways, and it examines the mechanisms which might be involved. Inflammation and nitro-oxidative stress are associated with both increased CB1 expression, via increased activity of the NADPH oxidases NOX4 and NOX1, and increased CNR1 expression and DNA methylation; and CB2 upregulation via increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, binding of the transcription factor Nrf2 to an antioxidant response element in the CNR2 promoter region and the action of miR-139. CB1 and CB2 have antagonistic effects on redox signalling, which may result from a miRNA-enabled negative feedback loop. The effects of inflammation and oxidative stress are detailed in respect of AEA and 2-AG levels, via effects on calcium homeostasis and phospholipase A2 activity; on FAAH activity, via nitrosylation/nitration of functional cysteine and/or tyrosine residues; and on 2-AG activity via effects on MGLL expression and MAGL. Finally, based on these detailed molecular neurobiological mechanisms, it is suggested that cannabidiol and dimethyl fumarate may have therapeutic potential for major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.
35775251	 Objective: To investigate the clinicopathological features of fumarate hydratase (FH) deficiency uterine leiomyoma. Methods: The data of 38 patients with FH deficiency uterine leiomyoma were screened and analyzed. The expressions of FH, S-(2-succino)-cysteine (2SC), desmin, p16, p53, CD10 and cell proliferation associated nuclear antigen (Ki-67) proteins were detected by immunohistochemistry, and their clinicopathological features were analyzed retrospectively. Results: (1) Clinical features: the median age of the patients was (42.57.4) years old. Twenty-one cases (55%) of them were myomas found in physical examination, and the median maximum diameter of the tumor was 6.0 cm (range: 5.0-7.5 cm); myomectomy was performed in 23 cases (61%), total hysterectomy with or without bilateral appendages in 15 cases (39%); laparoscopic surgery in 27 cases (71%), open surgery in 11 cases (29%); none of the patients had renal cell carcinoma. (2) Histological features: atypical nuclear cells were distributed locally or diffusely, eosinophilic nucleoli and intranuclear inclusion bodies could be seen, glass like globules could be seen in the cytoplasm, nuclear division was 0-4/10 high power field (HPF), and antler like blood vessels and pulmonary edema-like changes could be seen in the stroma. Among 38 patients with FH deficiency uterine leiomyoma, FH was negative in 37 cases (97%), and positive in 1 case (3%); 2SC, desmin, p16, p53, CD10 and Ki-67 showed focal positive expression in 38 cases (100%), including 35 cases (92%) with Ki-67 index10% and 3 cases (8%) with Ki-67 index 10%. (3) Follow-up: 4 cases (11%) recurred, and there was no death. There were significant differences in age, family history, distribution of atypical nuclei and mitosis number between recurrent group and non-recurrent group (all P0.05). Conclusions: FH deficiency uterine leiomyoma is a rare tumor, which needs pathological examination,immunohistochemical examination and clinical history. Patients younger than 43 years old, with family history, histologically atypical diffuse nuclear distribution and mitotic number 3/10 HPF should be alert to the risk of recurrence.
36000575	1,3-Dichloro-2-propanol (1,3-DCP), as a food pollutant, exists in a variety of foods. Studies have shown that it has nephrotoxicity. In the study, we found that 1,3-DCP caused renal injury with necroptosis in C57BL/6J mice. The mechanism of 1,3-DCP-caused nephrotoxicity was further explored in NRK-52E cells in vitro. We found that 1,3-DCP caused cell necroptosis with the increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and the expressions of RIPK3 and MLKL. But pretreatment with a ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), a RIPK3 inhibitor GSK'872, or RIPK3 gene silencing alleviated 1,3-DCP-induced cell necroptosis. The data indicated that 1,3-DCP induced necroptosis through the ROS/RIPK3/MLKL pathway in NRK-52E cells. In further mechanistic studies, we explored how 1,3-DCP induced ROS production. We found that 1,3-DCP inhibited the expressions of nuclear and cytoplasmic Nrf2. But pretreatment with an Nrf2 activator dimethyl fumarate (DMF) up-regulated the expressions of nuclear and cytoplasmic Nrf2 and down-regulated ROS levels and RIPK3 and MLKL expressions. We also examined the effects of mitophagy on 1,3-DCP-induced ROS. The data manifested that 1,3-DCP suppressed mitophagy in NRK-52E cells by decreasing LC3-II, Pink1, and Parkin levels, increasing p62 levels, and decreasing colocalization of LC3 and Mito-Tracker Red. Pretreatment with an autophagy activator rapamycin (Rapa) decreased 1,3-DCP-induced ROS. Taken together, our data identified that 1,3-DCP caused renal necroptosis through the ROS/RIPK3/MLKL pathway.
36290650	Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a well-known activator of Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2), used in the treatment of psoriasis and multiple sclerosis. The mechanism of action consists in the modification of the cysteine residues on the Nrf2-inhibitor Keap1, thus leading to the dissociation of these two proteins and the consequent activation of Nrf2. Considering the paucity of evidence of DMF effects in the context of retinal endothelium, this in vitro study investigated the role of DMF in human retinal endothelial cells (HREC). Here, we show for the first time in HREC that DMF activates the Nrf2 pathway, thus leading to an increase in HO-1 protein levels and a decrease in intracellular ROS levels. Furthermore, this molecule also shows beneficial properties in a model of hyperglucose stress, exerting cytoprotective prosurvival effects. The overall collected results suggest that DMF-mediated activation of the Nrf2 pathway may also be a promising strategy in ocular diseases characterized by oxidative stress. This study opens a new perspective on DMF and suggests its potential repositioning in a broader therapeutical context.
36581128	Fumarate hydratase (FH)-deficient renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an aggressive, rare genetic disease affecting the kidney and other organ systems. We constructed a specialized multi-institutional cohort of 20 primary FH-deficient RCC cases with aims of characterizing a new commercially available antibody, S-(2-succino)-cysteine (2SC). Herein, we present our findings on the biomarker characterization and performance of 2SC expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in FH-deficient RCC and other common and rare RCC subtypes. Morphological assessment revealed characteristic cytomorphologic features and a majority (55%) of FH-deficient RCC had mixed architectural growth patterns. We observed predominantly diffuse and strong cytoplasmic staining with limited nuclear positivity for 2SC staining on IHC. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) for 2SC identified the threshold IHC score (cutoff) as 90, with the sensitivity and specificity being 100% and 91%, respectively. The findings of the present study along with the prior evidence in literature encourageutilization of 2SC as a positive marker along with the loss of FHexpression by anti-FH IHC staining as a negative marker, in clinical and/or pathologic scenarios when considering FH-deficient RCC in the differential diagnosis. FH-/2SC+ may serve as a comprehensive IHC panel in identifying such cases and excluding morphologically similar entities.
36615301	Macrophages secrete a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) but abnormal release of cytokines unfortunately promotes cytokine storms. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an FDA-approved drug for multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment, has been found as an effective therapeutic agent for resolution. In this study, the anti-inflammatory effect of DMF was found to correlate to selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1). DMF irreversibly modified the Sec498 residue and C-terminal catalytic cysteine residues of TXNRD1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, cellular TXNRD activity was increased through up-regulation of the protein level and DMF inhibited TXNRD activity and the nitric oxide (NO) production of RAW 264.7 cells. Meanwhile, the inhibition of TXNRD1 by DMF would contribute to the redox regulation of inflammation and promote the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) activation. Notably, inhibition of cellular TXNRD1 by auranofin or TRi-1 showed anti-inflammatory effect in RAW 264.7 cells. This finding demonstrated that targeting TXNRD1 is a potential mechanism of using immunometabolites for dousing inflammation in response to pathogens and highlights the potential of TXNRD1 inhibitors in immune regulation.
36625376	Succination is a nonenzymatic and irreversible post-translational modification (PTM) with important biological significance, yielding S-(2-succino) cysteine (2SC) residue. This PTM is low in abundance and often requires a large amount of protein samples for 2SC quantification. In this work, an efficient quantification method based on ethanol/acetyl chloride chemical derivatization was developed. The three carboxyl groups of 2SC were all esterified to increase hydrophobicity, greatly improving its ionization efficiency. The sensitivity was increased by 112 times; the limit of detection was reduced to 0.885 fmol, and the protein usage was reduced by at least 10 times. The established method was used to detect the overall concentration of 2SC in fumarate accumulation cells quantitatively.
36729957	Approximately 1% to 1.5% of uterine leiomyomas are fumarate hydratase (FH)-deficient (FHd). A subset of these are associated with germline FH mutations. However, the prevalence and clinicopathologic characteristics of FHd uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS) remain unknown. Clinicopathologic data were collected for 348 uLMS. Morphologic features associated with FH deficiency (staghorn-type vessels, alveolar-pattern edema, macronucleoli with perinucleolar clearing, eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions, and chain-like nuclear arrangement) were documented. All 348 tumors were studied by FH immunohistochemistry. Eighty-nine were also studied by S-(2-succinyl)-cysteine (2SC) immunohistochemistry. Seven (2%) FHd uLMS were identified. Five showed uniformly negative FH and diffusely positive 2SC immunostaining; 1 showed variably negative to weak to strong FH and diffusely positive 2SC immunostaining; and 1 showed retained FH staining alongside positive 2SC confined to a morphologically distinct subclone. Three of 7 patients had extrauterine disease at presentation, and 3 of 6 had persistent disease or died from disease. Macronucleoli with perinucleolar clearing were significantly more common in FHd uLMS (7/7) than in uLMS with retained FH (182/341; P =0.017). Disease-specific survival, disease-free survival, and other morphologic features of FH deficiency did not differ significantly between FHd and FH-retained tumors. Our data emphasize that immunohistochemical FH deficiency does not preclude malignancy in uterine smooth muscle tumors. However, the biological significance and molecular basis of FH deficiency in uLMS, including any relationship to germline FH mutation, remain unknown, and a larger multi-institutional effort is necessary to gather sufficient FHd uLMS for more robustly powered clinicopathologic and for molecular characterization.
36734430	 Significance: Central nervous system (CNS) diseases are disorders of the brain and/or spinal cord and include neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a transcription factor belonging to the cap-n-collar (CNC) family that harbors a unique basic leucine zipper motif and plays as a master regulator of homeostatic responses. Recent Advances: Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) is an adaptor of the Cullin3 (CUL3)-based ubiquitin E3 ligase that enhances the ubiquitylation of NRF2, which promotes the degradation of NRF2 to suppress its transcriptional activity in the absence of stress. Cysteine residues of KEAP1 are modified under stress conditions, and NRF2 degradation is attenuated, allowing it to accumulate and induce the expression of target genes. This regulatory system is referred to as the KEAP1-NRF2 system and plays a central role in protecting cells against various stresses. NRF2 also negatively regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine genes and suppresses pathological inflammation. As oxidative stress, inflammation, and proteostasis are known to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases, the KEAP1-NRF2 system is an attractive target for the treatment of these diseases. Critical Issues: In mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases, Nrf2 depletion exacerbates symptoms and enhances oxidative damage and inflammation in the CNS. In contrast, chemical or genetic NRF2 activation improves these symptoms. Indeed, the NRF2-activating chemical dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is now widely used for the clinical treatment of MS. Future Directions: The KEAP1-NRF2 system is a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.

36951905	A novel moderately thermophilic heterotrophic bacterium, designated strain 143-21T, was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal chimney sample collected from the Central Indian Ridge at a depth of 2440m. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that strain 143-21T belongs to the genus Crassaminicella. It was most closely related to Crassaminicella thermophila SY095T (96.79% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Crassaminicella profunda Ra1766HT (96.52%). Genomic analysis showed that strain 143-21T shares 79.79-84.45%average nucleotide identity and 23.50-29.20%digital DNA-DNA hybridization with the species of the genus Crassaminicella, respectively. Cells were rod-shaped, non-motile, Gram-positive-staining. Terminal endospores were observed in stationary-phase cells when strain 143-21T was grown on Thermococcales rich medium. Strain 143-21T was able to grow at 30-60C (optimum, 50C), pH 6.5-8.5 (optimum, pH 7.0) and in 1.0-7.0% NaCl (w/v; optimum 2.0%, w/v). Strain 143-21T utilized fructose, glucose, maltose, mannose, ribose, N-acetyl-d-(+)-glucosamine and casamino acids, as well as amino acids including glutamate, lysine, histidine and cysteine. The main fermentation products from glucose were acetate (2.07mM), H2 and CO2. It did not reduce elemental sulphur, sulphate, thiosulphate, sulphite, fumarate, nitrate, nitrite and Fe (III). The predominant cellular fatty acids were C14:0 (48.8%), C16:0 (12.9%), and summed feature 3 (C16:17c and/or C16:16c; 10.2%). The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol, as well as two unidentified phospholipids and four unidentified aminolipids. No respiratory quinones were detected. Based on its phylogenetic analysis and physiological characteristics, strain 143-21T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Crassaminicella, for which the name Crassaminicella indica sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is strain 143-21T (=DSM 114408T= MCCC 1K06400T).
37053010	Germline or somatic loss-of-function mutations of fumarate hydratase (FH) predispose patients to an aggressive form of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Since other than tumor resection there is no effective therapy for metastatic FH-deficient RCC, an accurate method for early diagnosis is needed. Although MRI or CT scans are offered, they cannot differentiate FH-deficient tumors from other RCCs. Therefore, finding noninvasive plasma biomarkers suitable for rapid diagnosis, screening, and surveillance would improve clinical outcomes. Taking advantage of the robust metabolic rewiring that occurs in FH-deficient cells, we performed plasma metabolomics analysis and identified 2 tumor-derived metabolites, succinyl-adenosine and succinic-cysteine, as excellent plasma biomarkers for early diagnosis. These 2 molecules reliably reflected the FH mutation status and tumor mass. We further identified the enzymatic cooperativity by which these biomarkers are produced within the tumor microenvironment. Longitudinal monitoring of patients demonstrated that these circulating biomarkers can be used for reporting on treatment efficacy and identifying recurrent or metastatic tumors.
37215033	Crosstalk between metabolism and stress-responsive signaling is essential to maintaining cellular homeostasis. One way this crosstalk is achieved is through the covalent modification of proteins by endogenous, reactive metabolites that regulate the activity of key stress-responsive transcription factors such as NRF2. Several metabolites including methylglyoxal, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, fumarate, and itaconate covalently modify sensor cysteines of the NRF2 regulatory protein KEAP1, resulting in stabilization of NRF2 and activation of its cytoprotective transcriptional program. Here, we employed a shRNA-based screen targeting the enzymes of central carbon metabolism to identify additional regulatory nodes bridging metabolic pathways to NRF2 activation. We found that succinic anhydride, increased by genetic depletion of the TCA cycle enzyme succinyl-CoA synthetase or by direct administration, results in N-succinylation of lysine 131 of KEAP1 to activate NRF2 transcriptional signaling. This study identifies KEAP1 as capable of sensing reactive metabolites not only by several cysteine residues but also by a conserved lysine residue, indicating its potential to sense an expanded repertoire of reactive metabolic messengers.
37216617	Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF), Tecfidera, is approved globally for treating relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The disposition of DMF was determined in humans after administration of a single oral dose of [14C]DMF, and the total recovery was estimated to be between 58.4% to 75.0%, primarily through expired air.The absorption of [14C]DMF-derived radioactivity was rapid, with Tmax at 1h postdose. Glucose was the predominant circulating metabolite, accounting for 60% of the total extractable radioactivity. Cysteine and N-acetylcysteine conjugates of mono- or di-methyl succinate were found to be the major urinary metabolites.In vitro studies showed that [14C]DMF was mainly metabolised to MMF, and fumarase exclusively converted fumaric acid to malic acid and did not catalyse the conversion of fumaric acid esters to malic acid. DMF was observed to bind with human serum albumin through Michael addition to the Cys-34 residue when exposed to human plasma.These findings indicate that DMF undergoes metabolism via hydrolysis, GSH conjugation, and the TCA cycle, leading to the formation of citric acid, CO2, and water. These ubiquitous and well-conserved metabolism pathways minimise the risk of drug-drug interactions and reduce variability related to pharmacogenetics and ethnicity.
37263921	 Objective: To investigate the clinicopathologic and molecular characteristics of fumarate hydratase (FH) deficient uterine leiomyoma. Methods: Eighty cases of FH deficient uterine leiomyoma were diagnosed from April 2018 to September 2022 in Department of Pathology, Peking University Third Hospital. Sanger sequencing of FH gene exons (exon 1-10) were performed on tumor tissues and matched non-tumor tissues/peripheral blood for all cases. FH immunohistochemistry were performed in 74 cases; S-(2-succino)-cysteine (2SC) were also detected by immunohistochemistry in five cases. Results: Patients' age ranged from 18 to 54 (36.07.5) years, with more than 60% exhibiting clinical symptoms of multiple and large leiomyomas (the median diameter was 70 mm). More than four histologic features, including staghorn vasculature, alveolar-pattern edema, bizarre nuclei, oval nuclei arranged in chains, prominent eosinophilic nucleoli with perinucleolar haloes and eosinophilic intracytoplasmic globules were observed in 98.5% (67/68) patients. The immunohistochemical sensitivity of FH and 2SC were 97.3% and 100%, respectively. Based on the Sanger sequencing results, the cases were divided into germline variant group (31 cases), somatic variant group (29 cases) and no variant group (20 cases). Sixty-nine percent (20/29) of the patients with FH germline variation had clear family history. Conclusions: Clinical features, histological morphology, FH and 2SC immunohistochemistry and Sanger sequencing have their own significance and limitations in differential diagnosis of FH deficient uterine leiomyoma. In clinical practice, the above information should be fully integrated and studied for accurate pathologic diagnosis and selection of patients with FH germline variation.
